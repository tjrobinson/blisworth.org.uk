        circa 1953</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000080">The horse show was typically
        held in Feast week*, initially on a field behind the mill (Mr. Kelcher's
        farm<br>
        - Park Fields) and later on the grass field of Hill Farm adjacent to the
        farmhouse.&nbsp; In fact the Hill farm show<br>
        was the last, in 1953.&nbsp; These photographs&nbsp;
        were taken by
        J Payler at the Hill Farm event, courtesy of the<br>
        Osbornes.&nbsp; In the
        background to the right can be seen the farm
        house.<br>
        Note the splendid elm
        tree by the farm yard.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#000080">In this shot below can be seen,
        clearly in the original, the Baptist Chapel, the Coronation Cottages<br>
        and a fair slice of Blisworth.&nbsp; Coronation Cottages is the white
        building over the horse's tail.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#000080">Below, Mr P. W. Thompson, butcher at
        Broughton, one of many who enjoyed maintaining<br>
        these veteran rally carts** which were amiably raced.&nbsp; Note the acetylene lamps.</font></p>

        presented rally cart.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#000080">The 'impressario' for the whole
        event was Ernie Griffiths below, stock dealer whose family now live<br>
        in Milton Malsor.&nbsp; He is preparing to present an award.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <font color="#000080">Some events re-enacted chases over and&nbsp;
        around obstacles with a small pack of hounds.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#000080">Quite
        a few fairly famous eventers
        were frequenting this meeting in its heyday - above is a<br>
        picture of Allan Oliver.&nbsp; Below is a picture of Mrs Digby-Whitehead
        who evidently helped with<br>
        the organisation of the shows (as indicated in the dedication included
        in the picture.)&nbsp; Opinions<br>
        differ as to
        why the shows stopped but a prominent point related to an overly large local<br>
        committee
        to organise it each year and a disagreement
        developed within that committee.&nbsp; You<br>
        may
        download a <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Farming/HShow/download.php?filename=hshow.pdf">copy in PDF
        format</a> (1.8MB) of what is probably the first event held, in 1945.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000080">It seems odd to have a reference to
        L.M.S.
        Main Line on its front page but, of course, there<br>
        would be many people who would take the train
        and walk into the village from Blisworth station.</font></p>
