<p><font size="5"><b>1820 - from a Grafton Agents folding map (NRO).</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The date given for this map is an estimate that is mainly
based upon the drawn extent of the <a href="../../Articles/Stone-works.html">stoneworks
quarry</a>.&nbsp; The quarry project<br>
was brought to an aging Duke in 1820-1 but it is evident from letters that the
quarry was started before then, perhaps 1810.&nbsp; The map<br>
shows a very small quarry, hence the estimate 1820.&nbsp; Another factor is that
Geo. Stone farms one field next to Ford Lane yet he is not<br>
included in the 1821-4 rent records.&nbsp; A rent book is missing and we find
Stone renting many fields (~ 6) by 1834 having arrived in the<br>
village in 1825.&nbsp; Consequently the
map is a basic 1820 plan with farmer colourings-in (note how the one field is
strongly coloured) and<br>
annotation updated to c1826.&nbsp; There are pencil lines showing <i>ideas</i> for the new railway
station and the spur for Northampton etc. that<br>
must be c1836.&nbsp; The by-pass
has no other record - available Vestry records begin 1890.</font></p>
