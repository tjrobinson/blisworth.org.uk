        <b>Introduction:</b>&nbsp; In 1808 the enclosure award for the
        fields in the parish of Blisworth was passed.&nbsp; To be precise:
        statute 48 George III cap. 29 authorised the enclosure of 1500 acres of
        land in the parish of Blisworth and thus <b> removed all common land rights</b>
        of any parisher or farmer, whether small or large.&nbsp; An award was made under
        this act (thereby assigning them to specific farmers selected by, in
        this case, the Duke of Grafton) in the Court of Common Pleas, Recovery
        Roll, 55 George III, 1815, Trinity, CP43/929, rot. 58.&nbsp; There are
        two maps with this award in which the field numbers are included and the
        tally of fields to farmers is listed in the main text.&nbsp; However,
        the documents in the NRO do not include this tally. In Towcester on July
        15th 1808 there was the first meeting of the award commissioners at
        which farmers were granted their new rights.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">The process of making the
        enclosure award was
        the cumulation of a 300 years period in which certain farmers had
        already been favoured with large quotas of land for which they paid rent
        in parallel with many villagers who were assigned strips in various fields in
        the 'ridge and furrow' pattern.&nbsp; In the early days it was sheep
        farming for wool that appealed to the Lord of the Manor; by encouraging that on
        the enclosed fields the Duke was exacting a much higher rent from the
        much more productive farmers, who effectively became the first agri-businesses.&nbsp;
        <a href="../../Bridges-history.htm">In 1718, the curate</a> remarked
        that &quot;a small part of the parish was enclosed but this was
        not true.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">In 1808, the list of awarded farmers is as follows: William
        Gibbs, Robert Campion, Inigo Hands, William Goodrich, John Goodrich,
        Thomas Wesley, Stephen Blunt, William Worster, John Kingston, William
        Wilson, John Pettifer, John Dix, Sam Wilson, George Stone, John Goode,
        Thomas Parrish, Richard Gudgeon and the 'Rector'.&nbsp; The Rector was
        assigned ~250 acres in lieu of all the other parishes in the Deanery (or
        so it is thought), hence the creation of Glebe Farm to the west of the village.&nbsp; Note that the
        farmers Plowman and Brafield are not included; Plowman was forced to
        sell up in
        1779 and Brafield had moved to Tiffield before 1800.</font></p>
        <p align="center" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">----------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">With
        regard to the earliest dated information suggested in the Timeline
        table, the terrain suggests that a considerable area of the parish was
        wooded or otherwise 'waste' before 1500. Referring to the first map
        below, early wooded areas are outside the magenta lines, to leave a band
        of un-wooded land running from north to south through the entire parish. The land usage figures are
        guesses.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080"><b>1265
        - 1542:</b> Towards the end of this period the Lords of the Manor were
        eminent characters. Having considerable influence was Thomas Wake V who
        owned a prodigious amount of land in the east-midlands and was three
        times the sheriff of Northamptonshire and an expert in Law.&nbsp; A
        growing awareness of the importance of enclosing a significant
        proportion of land (under presumed self-sufficiency constraints) to
        provide grass for animals and a level of fertilisation from keeping
        those animals so that (i) in terms of rotation the use of both corn and
        grass or other leys worked best for the land, (ii) the availability of a
        modest amount of meat (plus some for sale in town) and a significant
        amount of wool (either woven locally or for sale in town) was beneficial
        to the local economy, was gaining ground in the 16C (see
        &quot;Pre-industrial England&quot; by B.A.Holderness, 1976). Notable also
        was the founding of a free school in Blisworth in the late 15C which
        must have helped households start some specialist skills alongside
        peasantry.&nbsp; Perhaps 30%
        of what was hitherto ridge &amp; furrow areas were enclosed as part of
        the cooperative (feudal) system. In this period there would have been an
        effort, though interrupted by the Black Death, to cut back the waste and
        woods. NB: it has not escaped notice that the wooded region named
        &quot;Berry Hill&quot; may have been really a <i>bury hill</i> site for
        the black death victims. Assarts in the early years were for heavy timbers for building
        while clearances would be needed to keep up with population increases in
        the late years. The next step was for cooperative feudal farms to be
        taken over by rent-paying farmers appointed by the Lord of the Manor.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080"><b>1542
        - 1649:</b> We know little of the abilities of the seniors in
        terms of land improvement. Records are sparse for this period but some
        Church documents dated 1617, that deal with the protection of about 7
        pieces of land worked in aid of maintaining lights at the altars mention
        some 17 senior members of Blisworth 13 of which were definitely tenant
        farmers. This fact indicates that the clustering of fields into
        separately run farms was well advanced by 1600 and that the sale and enclosure that occurred in 1649 probably involved land that was already
        enclosed.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080"><b>1649
        - 1660:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A major process of enclosure took place in 1649,
        occurring in the
        Cromwell <a href="../../Development/manor-summary.htm">Commonwealth
        period</a> 1648 - 1660.&nbsp; About 85% of the parish was sold and it
        seems likely that the best land already enclosed plus perhaps some
        common land was sold.&nbsp; Some 1600 acres altogether is thought to
        have been taken up by entrepreneurs. However it is almost a certainty that whilst
        leases were taken on some common land the peasantry were allowed to
        continue their cooperative style food-growing.&nbsp; Indeed, the scope
        for radical changes in only the 11 years while the commonwealth
        continued seems limited. In 1660 Charles II took back the lands which
        for Blisworth was the Honour of Grafton, and endowed the Duke of Grafton as the owner. Around this time it is
        probable that the mill pond was bypassed with a deeply dug stream
        cutting and so drained. It is also likely that the fish-pool was drained
        also since both these areas are referred to in Grafton's mapping for his
        1727 survey as enclosed fields. In
        any event, if peasants were excluded from tracts of land in the period
        1649 - 1660, it seems likely that those conditions would continue
        afterwards.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"></center><font color="#000080"><b>1727:</b>&nbsp; The Duke's survey was
        commissioned in 1725.&nbsp; A map of the parish (map 4212 NRO) shows
      enclosed areas and fields designated as furlongs which one assumes to
      still be part of the open field area. The map is redrawn in D. Hall's
      atlas (The Atlas of Northamptonshire, by T. Partida, D. Hall and G. Foard)
      and that is reproduced with permission here. It is a combination of
      configurations: the hatched areas represent open fields and the green
      areas with a fields layout are supposed to be enclosed but the field
      layout shown is that which pertained <u> after</u> formal enclosure in
        1808 yet an applicable date for this map is 1725. Note
      that roads are inconsistently shown and, in some areas, the path of the 19C
      canal is indicated (which is a graphical error).</font></p>

      <a name="ptfarming"></a>To properly appreciate what applied in 1727 one
      needs to inspect the detailed draft drawings of the estate which are given
      on maps no. 2323 and 2800 NRO. For example, consider the section shown
      below for a small area on both sides of the Northampton Road - enclosures
      on the west side (mostly) and furlongs ie. open fields to the east and
      bordering Milton Malsor parish. The level of subdivision was much finer. One remarkable
      feature is that there are at least 44 cottages in the village to
      which are assigned useful sized plots of land, 0.5 to 2 acres.&nbsp; Along
      the Northampton Rd and in some other places there are also over 46 further
      small fields, 0.25 to 4 acres.&nbsp; As an example, Mary Jones rented a
      cottage in Mill Lane (Chapel Lane) with 1.1 acre extending down to the
      mill brook and this cost her £1.75 per year.&nbsp; She also rented 2
      acres at the northern end of the parish which cost a further £2.33 per
      year.&nbsp; It is evident that many households took similar tenancies and were
      obviously involved in part-time
      farming and that this activity must have sprung up after the
      entrepreneurial owners had departed in 1660.&nbsp;This adds to the picture
      presented in Holderness's book; it is tempting to assume that many households included (i) a member
      engaged in farm labouring on a yeoman's estate, (ii) someone working at
      part-time farming (probably growing basic food for the family and animals,
      such as potatoes and turnips, at the remote field while keeping the animals, such
      as pigs and chickens, on
      the 'home' patch) and (iii) someone engaged in a specialist skill such as
      that which supports farming or lace-making or weaving, cooking or
      butchering etc.&nbsp; Such households would be well off.&nbsp;An
      alternative interpretation is that the households are involved in
      full-time farming because they also have a number of lands in the open
      field area. However, such lands were abolished by 1808 and virtually all the small plots were coalesced by
      then.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">A
      further point should be made. The open field area of 820 acres is
      dominated by a total of 600 acres rented by as few as 10 farmers. That
      farming was a specialism, ie. a career, in the 1700s is a fact, at least
      for this parish. It has been pointed out that, in the absence of any
      remaining evidence, those farmers had taken a finely distributed array of
      lands that totalled 40 to 100 acres.&nbsp; With that input, we are
      supposed to believe that a typical career farmer held an enclosed area (in
      a number of plots) of about 40 to 100 acres and a similar total area as
      finely distributed lands. This is not a sustainable farming mode. More likely is the idea that, under the control
      of a village based committee (rather than the agent for the Duke), farmers
      and small-holders worked together to coalesce their lands in the open
      fields and, probably
      ahead of the formal enclosure, proceeded to graduslly enclose areas especially for
      grazing (meat and wool production).&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><img border="0" src="1727NptonRd.jpg" width="850" height="987"></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">As
      mentioned above, the total area of all
      open fields was about 820 acres while the total of enclosed fields was 850
      acres, leaving about 200 acres of woodland. The honest answer to how much
      of the parish was enclosed at the time would be 45% yet the curate Revd. Bullyer aimed to hide this fact when questioned for <i>Bridge's History</i>. Map 4212
      also carries a &quot;lie&quot; in its
      drafting. This map shows with
      hatching the open fields correctly (we assume), yet at certain points omits field boundaries completely from an
      enclosed area. It even draws in a bold pathway across a pale green wash
      that links with the Ford Lane access and then wends its way along the edge
      of the open field as far as the Gayton boundary. The pathway aligns with
      the gateways between the fields yet neither gates nor hedges are shown.
      Its route is shown in <a href="mill-stream.jpg">a map that is used on this
      website to make other points</a>. Why such a presentation was made is open
      to speculation:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (a) the map was a decorative romantic view to merely show visitors in the Duke's
      mansion.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (b) by colouring green, grazing was suggested.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (c) the extent of enclosure was masked.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (d) enclosure is there but main point was to show an early &quot;right of
      way&quot; (that diminished the need for Ford Lane)</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">The
      combination of (a) and (d) seem the most plausible.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">Turning
      to a further example of entrepreneurship by farmers, consider the following
      detail shown in the
      1727 mapping, in particular in map 2323 NRO where they appears to be
      examples of field coalescence. See below.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><img border="0" src="1727-Towcester.jpg" width="912" height="690"></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">The
      Towcester Road is shown running towards the bottom left-hand corner. The
      Saltway is shown exitting the parish at left. It crosses the parish just
      south of the furlong called Woolford Gapp. The <i>Gapp</i> refers to the
      gateway construction across the Towcester Road where the old Tiffield
      Parish boundary (purple line) used to run before about 1685. The field
      named Wolfey Common Field was assigned to the Parish at about that time
      and was called Oxhay (the <i>hay</i> suggesting gateway - between
      parishes) when it was a part of Tiffield. Interestingly, although it straddles the
      road its tenure appears to be divided between four farmers without firm
      boundaries such as hedges. The areas could groups of lands. They could be
      cropped identically in a manner that could anticipate enclosure.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080"><a name="animals"></a>The
      more interesting feature on this map segment is the pathway marked in pale
      yellow. It runs between a series of open fields on both sides, namely;
      Astley, Shelly Ley, Long Ley, Saltway furlong (mistaken geography here!),
      Spinney, Whitings Hedge furlong. It serves a small box enclosure that
      intersects and interferes with the Towcester Road and seems to offer
      priority access to the village although a number of gates appear to be omitted.
      The enclosure was designed to gather animals into a group for driving
      along the Towcester Road. Although the lands of each furlong field maybe
      still have been identifiable, they were clearly managed together for grazing
      sheep or cows. Possibly only half the total area of the six fields was
      assigned to communal grazing at a time. Nevertheless the central pathway
      highlighted in yellow indicates a level of group farming that necessitates
      enclosure for it to be successful.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">By
      the 'gapp' on the Towcester Road is a small trapezoidal field that once
      may have contained a building related to the gate. That site is now
      occupied by the Pynus terraced cottages built by Joseph Westley jnr.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">There
        is second enclosure or yard which crosses the Towcester Road. A
        possibility is that this yard facilitated stone extraction in the field
        to the south as <a href="../../Listed/houses-quarries.htm">discussed
        elsewhere</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080"><b>1790:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Continuing conversion
      from common land to useful arable land was in progress for we
      learn that by 1790 there was a list of assignees to the common-land.&nbsp; They were Robert Campion, Thomas Cave,
      Richard Gibbs, Cornelius
        Gudgeon, Joseph Hedge, Joseph Wills, Shadrach Wesley, William Pettifer -
        each holding 60 to 120 acres, each with permission to fence it off.&nbsp;
      This would not have happened unless the demand from the remaining &quot;strip-farmers&quot; had already waned - we know this because Shadach Wesley was
      a Baptist and Robert Campion was well-respected in the village.&nbsp; In some cases a large, originally
      open, field was subdivided and farmed by a subgroup of these tenants
        such as 'Long Stocking Field', the hither-part (nearest) of Nether
        (north) Field (and this had already occurred by 1727), Nether Palmers Bank and Willow Stump Furlong, etc.&nbsp;
        Unfortunately the location of many of these ancient named fields is
        unknown.&nbsp;But there is evidence here of an ongoing move towards
      complete enclosure of the
      common lands.&nbsp;There is further Northamptonshire evidence from a <a href="../1791_Farming.htm#inclosure">commentator
      on farming in 1791</a> that an ongoing enclosure was effectively taking up
      land that was not used, furthermore, the Duke of Grafton reported that
      there was no increase in families committed to the parish (ie.
      &quot;registered&quot; poor) during a period of enclosure in Pottesbury,
      1774 - 1787.&nbsp; There should be no doubt that these were 'selected'
      statistics. By 1800 it seems doubtful that any
      villagers were still using common land for arable production.&nbsp; It is
      also doubtful they would have fenced a patch for animals because of the high
      likelihood of theft from somewhere so far from the village.&nbsp; The main
      issue was probably that they
      would have continued to exercise common land rights in terms of wood
      collection to fuel their meager winter heating and it is likely that the majority
      of villagers would try to do that.&nbsp; We have a few Court Leet
      documents that show that meetings still took place in
      1725-1777.&nbsp; This narrow time span for still available documents is
      interesting; there was a fire at Euston House and this has resulted in
      there being no documents held by Grafton&nbsp; for Blisworth before
      1725.&nbsp; If the Court Leet documents actually ceased in 1777 then
      perhaps so did the meetings - perhaps marking the end of cultivation by
      distributed lands.&nbsp; We have Church Vestry
      minutes from 1867 to 1895 and these minutes are almost completely devoid
      of any sort of 'business' items (until the planning of new sewers in 1890) so it is not possible to determine whether the Vestry
      took over the Court Leet function.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the Court Leet there was emphasis on <a href="../../Articles/Law_and_order.htm"> the appointment of officers</a> of the
      parish and nomination of constables,
      control of animal movements but very little was said about strip farming
      apart from indicating ~100 constables were involved in 1725 and 67 in
      1777, an indication of lessening land area.&nbsp; One 1725 note is interesting; farmers were
      reminded to maintain their individual lower boundaries so that the mill brook may flow
      freely.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080"><b>Later
      years:</b>&nbsp; There is
      evidence of an on-going transition from strip farming to a modern pattern but the
      picture is far from clear.&nbsp; Were the formal changes simply reflecting a
      trend, as sometimes suggested above, or were the changes forcing villagers to find other ways of
      providing food and/or income?&nbsp; There is little social commentary that
      could help answer the question.&nbsp; We have little information on
      mortality or on the flight of villagers to Northampton in this
      period.&nbsp; As sources of income before 1800 there was only
      agriculture and its infra-structural needs for the lowly educated, also for the wives, lace-making and
      being a servant or house-cleaner.&nbsp; For others there were trades, such
      as milling, carpentry and blacksmithing, and
      we have evidence of small shops and a few pubs - this mostly for the
      Victorian era.&nbsp; In the period <i> after</i> 1800 conditions were much
      better; there was the Canal and its
      wharf as a work place, there was the stone quarry from 1810, the railway
      works from 1835 and ironstone digging and working at the Hotel and gardens from
      1850.&nbsp;
      As an example, in 1871, about 60 men worked as labourers for 9 farmers and
      45 others were general labourers, some no doubt part-timing for farmers. <a href="../../Census/Work/Blisworth-people.htm"> Specialist
      skills</a>,
      for men, included milling,
      quarrying and carpentry accounting for another 30 men while a host of
      other professions (butchery, railways, retail, teaching, post-working,
      clerical, blacksmithing, baking, coal delivery and baking) accounted for
      70 more men.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">The removal of <b>all
      common land rights</b> in 1808 probably did not impact the village
      heavily, especially <i> if a dispensation for firewood had been provided
      earlier</i>;&nbsp;we
      do not know if it was.&nbsp; The
      Duke did however make one little concession - he converted about 10 acres
      at the Warren (Conygres Leys) <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/allot-history.pdf"> into about 100 allotments</a> of approximately 4
      poles each (1 pole = 1/40 acre).&nbsp; The date of this action is not recorded,
      assumed between 1815 and 1839 (the later being the date of a Grafton
      survey that shows the established allotments).&nbsp; Interestingly, <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">in
      1838 the Royal Agricultural Society was formed, so maybe that was a
      stimulus or w</span>as the action simply an example of the
      Duke realising the consternation in the village in losing common land
      rights and asking for some
      suggestions on how he might help? A plausible alternative stimulus to the
        Duke may have been the controversy at the time of the &quot;Swing
        Riots&quot;, calling for better conditions for mere labourers, which
        mostly occurred in the south - that was in 1830-1.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080">Anyway,
      providing allotments was certainly
      not to compensate for the loss <i>per se </i>of common land strip farming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
      course, by 1860, the
      Duke's son did not worry too much about these allotments when the money
      for ironstone began to come in; about half of the allotments were
      ruinously converted to sub-soil by the crude methods used.&nbsp; There may
      have been a row over the mining but we have no Church Vestry records for
      that period.&nbsp; By the time of the formation of the Parish Council in
      1894 the topic was evidently &quot;old news&quot; although the minutes
      were detailed.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 9; padding-right: 6"><font color="#000080"><b>After 1800 and Field Names:</b>&nbsp; As fields were
        subdivided by the farmers to conform to their land management
        requirements the names were gradually revised.&nbsp; There is a Duke's
        Agent's compact map, date estimated at 1825, at the NRO which gives all
        fields and minor subdivisions a 3 or 4 digit number, along with a name
        sometimes obscurely scribbled in pencil.&nbsp; The very small divisions
        such as used by Mary Jones c 1727 are all merged by 1825 into nearby larger fields -
        evidently the incomes of those households that used them have improved
        by 1825&nbsp; and any ongoing demand for them was ignored.&nbsp; A portion of
        <a href="../../1820/southfield.htm">this
        map is shown here</a>.&nbsp; It would be a major
        undertaking to recreate the map in a clear modern format.&nbsp; The 1825
        map shows no common land at all.&nbsp; It does reveal maybe 50 acres of
        ex-woodland on the Plain that was held &quot;in hand&quot; pending
        clearance for arable cultivation.&nbsp; The
        Grafton Survey of 1839 lists just a few small fields with their tenants at the
        time but, for any field that is away from the village smallholdings and
        cottage assignments, there is no map to provide the precise location.&nbsp; Mona
        Clinch collected all names in the parish in 1935 and published a map in
        her little book about Blisworth.&nbsp; There is a <a href="../fieldnames.htm">review
        of Blisworth field names</a> and their interpretations where possible.</font>
