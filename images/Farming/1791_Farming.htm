        <h4 align="center"><font color="#000080"><b>FIELDS</b></font></h4>
        <h4 align="left"><font color="#000080">I. <em>Arable</em></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The soil of the whole country classes under the
        general denomination of clay, that is to say, it is strong and wet;
        there are many tracts of loam on a sound bottom, but the general feature
        is different.&nbsp; Some open fields yet remain, but the chief part
        of the country has been inclosed by acts of Parliament. Courses of crops
        in these are:&nbsp; Fallow, Wheat, Beans; or beans and pease, Oats or,
        on drier soils: Fallow, Wheat, Oats, Clover, Wheat.&nbsp; Alternatives
        are: Turnips, Barley, Clover, Wheat, Oats; or beans and pease.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">In their tillage they give four earths to a
        fallow; three or four for turnips; two for barley or oats; one for pease
        or beans. Seed, and produce as follow: of wheat they sow two bushels and
        reap three quarters; of barley and oats, sow four bushels and gain five
        quarters; of beans, sow four or four and a half, and get three and a
        half quarters; of pease, sow three bushels, and have three quarters; of
        pease and beans mixed, sow four, and reap three and a half quarters.
        These products are from lands that are in the arrangement of two crops
        to a fallow; but if more cropping, then full half a quarter per acre is
        to be deducted from these products. The manure, consisting of yard dung,
        is spread very generally on the fallows for wheat, the sheep-sold is
        reckoned to give better wheat than yard dung: but the beans which sollow
        are better after that. The best circumstance of improvement introduced
        in the above courses is that of sowing white clover and tresoil, and a
        little raygrass (better perhaps omitted) with the common clover, and
        leaving it in <em>layer</em> , four, or five, or six years, chiefly fed:
        this is called up-and-down land. They break up this layer with a crop of
        oats, and either take a second, or sow the stubble with wheat.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">In the open fields, the course most common
        is: Fallow, Wheat, Beans, or pease and beans, which is perhaps the most barbarous management
        any where to be met with. If there is in agriculture one plant
        determinately appropriate for the preparation of another, it is beans
        for wheat. Turnips are not better adapted, in this respect, to barley,
        than beans are to wheat. To sow this crop on fallow, and succeeding it
        with beans, is, therefore, to put the cart before the horse. The
        improvement to be recommended on soils stiff and harsh, but so adapted
        to beans, as to yield them every third year, is this course: Beans,
        Wheat.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">But in this course the beans must be kept
        cleaner than is commonly practicable in a broadcast crop; they should,
        on every account, if possible, he drilled; but in whatever manner the
        seed may be deposited, such lands ought never to be ploughed early
        enough in the spring for sowing beans; they are commonly too wet and too
        saddened to go upon at that season of the year: they should be ploughed
        in autumn, and no spring tillage given, but the beans put in, whether by
        the drill, or by the harrow, or by the dibbler, on that stale furrow.
        They should be kept absolutely clean, which is done cheaply, if drilled,
        and their stubble, when the crop is removed, thoroughly shimmed or
        scuffled, and the land ploughed once for wheat. This husbandry, ill
        performed, would, I believe, be at least as profitable as the present
        management; well performed it would very far exceed it. It is here
        thought an excellent husbandry, to turn sheep into the bean fields, to
        eat the weeds, in May, and till the crop is in blossom. Some material
        alteration should certainly be made in their bean culture, for I saw
        many wretched crops, and scandalously full of weeds; unfortunate seasons
        for this product may not be in their power to remedy, but to allow their
        land to be occupied by myriads of weeds, in blossom and in feed, is in
        their power to prevent. I saw some in <a name="pn_29" href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=7583">Blisworth</a>
        Field most notably foul.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Cabbages are cultivated, by some persons, for
        cattle, but on a small scale; they are, however, on the increase.</font></p>
        <h4 align="left"><font color="#000080">II. <em>Grass.</em></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Two circumstances occur in the management of
        grass land, which deserves noting: first, a practice which is gaining
        ground in this neighbourhood, in manuring; it is to spread the dung upon
        them in July, as soon as the hay is cleared. The right time of dunging
        is a question of importance; it must either be done at this season, in
        autumn, or in the frosts of the winter; objections bear against both
        these seasons. The frost of winter takes its full effect upon the
        manure, be fore the grass can reap any advantage; and the effect of
        frosts on the volatile alkali, and on spirits, is to deprive them of
        their peculiar qualities; the alkali loses its pungent salt, and the
        spirit its inflammability. The same effect must take place on dung,
        exposed to the same agent. The winter rains come also while the manure
        is too much exposed on the surface, and its virtues are washed from off
        the field, before vegetation is awakened by the fun. But in July, though
        a severe drought may possibly damage the manure, by exhalation, yet the
        probability of rain is great; and if it comes, the quick growth of the
        after- grass shelters and protects it better, perhaps, than by any other
        means. In this case, however, I would certainly recommend, that this
        after-growth should be left through winter, to be fed in the spring,
        when the value of such food is extraordinarily great, and the dung, by
        means of such a covering, will be guarded against he frost, in the best
        possible manner. I have known the practice here mentioned pursued in
        other counties, with great success. The arrangement of the work of a
        farm, will not be impeded by manuring at this season, as it will not be
        wanted to be performed till after turnip sowing is over.<sup><a shape="rect" href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=Young&amp;c_id=5&amp;cpub_id=0#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title>1</a></sup></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The other circumstance I meant to speak to, is
        an experiment of the Duke of Grafton's, of rolling down ant hills,
        instead of cutting them. I rode over a large pasture, which I should not
        have known had ever been infested with these hills, if I had not been
        assured that it was once covered with them: no other method was used
        than repeated rollings, with a very heavy roller. It may be useful to
        know, that this way will succeed, as it may be better adapted to certain
        situations and circumstances, than the more common process.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The greatest improvement of which this counrty,
        perhaps, is capable. is that of turning the innumerable and beautiful
        springs, with which it abounds, to profit, by watering their meadows,
        and by converting all the arable, below the levels of those springs, to
        meadow: many thousand pounds a year might easily, by this means, be
        added to the rental of the country, and much greater sum to the product
        of it. The Duke of Grafton shewed me two noble springs, one of which
        gushes out of the earth, on the side of a hill, near <a name="pn_30" href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=7583">Blisworth</a>,
        and the other rises in a farm yard, at Caswell, in <a name="pn_31" href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=8107">Guns
        Norton</a>; each of them is powerful enough, after the severe drought we
        have had, for so many months, to water many acres, if judiciously
        carried along the slopes of the hills, as high as the level will allow.
        There is, also, a small, but perennial, river, sufficient to water many
        thousands of acres, but no use whatever made of it. This is surely to be
        regretted.</font></p>
        <h4 align="left"><font color="#000080">III. <em>Live Stock.</em></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The principal and staple live stock of all this
        neighbourhood are cows; the milk entirely applied to making butter,
        which goes fresh to London, where it is sold by the name of <em>Epping</em>
        . Many of the dairies rise to 30, 40, and even 50 cows. The butter fells
        on an average at 9d. per pound clear at home; 10d. in winter and 8d. in
        summer. They send it pretty equally the year round. The grass is good
        enough for fattening large oxen, but butter, at this price, is reckoned
        a much more profitable produce. There is, however, a circumstance which
        is attributed to soil and the quality of the food, that deserves noting:
        whatever may be the breed of cows, and they have all breeds, none will
        milk late in life; all have disorders in the bag much sooner than in
        many other counties. The common breed is the long horned Leicester and
        Warwick: they are mostly bought in, but some are bred, and many more at
        present than formerly, especially for the last five years, in which
        prices have so much advanced; and they remark, that the cows bred here <em>come
        kindlier to the soil</em> than those bought in. The quantity of butter
        given by some cows is very considerable; for instance, 12lb. a week, for
        at least one in a dairy of 40; average of a whole dairy 5lb. a week the
        year round, for all that are milked. Gross produce 6l. a year each cow,
        including the calf, at 12s. 6d. at four or five days old. Pigs amount to
        10s. per cow. In winter, all that are milked are fed upon hay, when dry
        on straw, till within a month of calving. There is no rule adhered to of
        keep after-grass for them, though so highly beneficial and valuable in
        the spring. The farmers who breed have their cattle of course in a
        succession; take for instance a dairy of 50.</font></p>

        to give cattle the red water that feed on them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Many sheep are kept; the Wiltshires are bought

        The former are never folded; only the latter; the western ewes are
        bought at three or four shear for 20s. or 21s. each; they are returned
        within the year, the lambs at that price; the ewe and the fleece 23s. to
        24s. The Burford ewes are bought also at 20s. these are kept for stock,
        but <em>culled</em> every year; the oldest are fattened and the ram
        given to the <em>culls</em> , to answer the purpose of westerns; ewes of

        they commonly employ sworn-winders, with whom the tod is 28lb. as refuse
        and dirty locks are picked out.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Breeding horses is not an inconsiderable
        article in live stock; in a team of eight, for two ploughs, there will
        usually be two mares kept, they are worked within a fortnight of
        foaling, but rested after for six weeks or two months, wean at
        Michaelmas, and the colts are then worth from 7l. to 12l. average 9l. It
        is common to fell at five years old, from 20l. to 35l. Generally put
        them to work at two years old, after which time they earn their living.
        In winter they are fed with straw, and a bushel of oats per week, in
        spring sowing hay. They do not use winter tares for soiling, which is a
        barbarous neglect.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><em><font color="#000080">Farms.</font></em></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">In the open fields the farms are generally
        small, usually about 70l. a-year: these little occupations with which
        the Duke of Grafton, and other good landlords have patience in order to
        nurse up industrious families, are yet a heavy loss in repairs: and
        sometimes in other circumstances: inclosed farms tise to 300l. which is
        the greatest; there are but few of 200l. to 250l. In farms of a
        tolerable size, the tenantry are substantial, and it gave me great
        pleasure to find them with such confidence in their landlord, as to
        raise considerable erections on the Duke's farms at their own expence,
        in articles beyond the common demands of the country; as a hay barn,
        &amp;. &amp;. and this while tenants at will; a sure proof that they
        regard their landlord as their father and their friend.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><em><font color="#000080">Rent.</font></em></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The general rent of the inclosed lands is 15s.
        to 18s. average perhaps 17s. or near it, tythe free: open fields subject
        to tythe, 8s. The rent of arable land has risen within ten years about
        1s. 6d. an acre.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><em><font color="#000080">Stock and Produce.</font></em></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">They commonly reckon 4l. an acre necessary for
        stocking farms: and that the produce of arable lands is about four or
        four and a half rents, with a fallow; and five or five and a half,
        without one.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">I enquired particularly if the produce of the
        land, without paying any regard to rent, had risen of late years, and I
        was assured that it had considerably <em>in quantity</em> , as well as
        in price.</font></p>

        2s. 6d. per pound, and rates 4s.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The Duke of Grafton's considerable farm here is
        fenced in the utmost perfection. All done with white thorn hedges, so
        admirably preserved by posts with double and even treble rails, that not
        a head of cattle, of any kind, seems ever to have had a bite at them.
        They are set in double rows, and the growth is such as to form a
        spectacle pleasing to behold.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><em><font color="#000080">Tillage.</font></em></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The lands of this country are all thrown up in
        the broad ridge and furrow, which is almost universal in the central
        counties. The success of the practice depends on the attention with
        which they convey the water from the furrows; when this is effected,
        there is no better method of laying land; inconveniencies there
        undoubtedly are, but all should give way to effective draining, which
        can only be thus performed on truly tenacious soils. These lands are <em>cast</em>
        (ploughed down) for spring corn, and arched for wheat. They plough with
        four horses at length, and even five; price 7s. an acre. It is
        remarkable, that they very rarely harrow, except for couch-grass. It is
        seldom that they give an autumnal earth either to fallows or the land
        for beans; thinks it does no good; and the land never works kindly after
        it in the spring. But <em>quere</em> if this is not owing to going on it
        too soon in the spring? Fallows left till spring sowing is over, cannot
        sometimes be ploughed at all, as I have seen often on this journey: and
        for beans there should, on such soils, be no spring tillage.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The Duke of Grafton's steward, Mr. Roper,<sup>2
        </sup>who came from Suffolk, brought with him ploughs for the horses to
        go abreast, but on trial he said it would not do, the land was too much
        trampled, the plough too short and unsteady. I have no doubt of this
        being the fact, for the common plough of Suffolk will not plough, in any
        soil, above four inches deep; if it is made to go six deep, there are
        few worse ploughs, for in that case the furrow is ill turned, and worse
        cleaned, and the draught required is great; but for four inches, in a
        soil not too strong, it is a good little tool. The ploughs of this
        country are by no means free from capital objections: the copse, or
        head, admits no variations of depth, done only by altering the traces,
        which is a barbarous defect; all the horses, except the hinder one, draw
        from the tuck of his collar harness, which 1s throwing a portion of the
        weight of all their draughts on his back, and is greatly increased when,
        for making the plough go shallower, the ridge chain which goes over his
        back is shortened. The share is from four to six inches broad, yet the
        heel of the plough is ten to fourteen inches, consequently these are
        eight to ten inches in every furrow not cut, but only driven over by
        force; this explains the thistles, so common on many fallows: it was, in
        answer to this objection, replied, that they do not often plough a
        furrow fourteen inches wide, though the plough is of that width in the
        heel; but this implies a yet greater error, which is, tilting the plough
        aside, in its work, to raise the earth board, which narrows the furrow,
        it is true, but infallably rest-baulks the land, and makes of all other
        work the worst. The length of the beam and of the handles, are good
        points, but might be had with a better plough; the beam, however, is not
        so long as they are willing to suppose, for it measures not to its own
        end, where it unites with the handles, but to the heel of the plough. As
        the line of traction, formed by the horse's draught, ascertains the
        right length of the beam, it will be longer for horses that draw at
        length, than for a pair of horses that draw abreast; the length of the
        Northampton beam is, therefore, proper: the share fastens on in a
        stronger and firmer manner than in the Suffolk plough.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">But the most interesting object in the rural
        oeconomy of Wakefield Lodge, is the forest of Whittlewood, which extends
        in length above 11 miles, but is narrow in many places; and contains, by
        a rough estimation, near 7000 common acres. I n it the underwood
        belongs, by a grant of the Crown, in the time of Charles II. to the Duke
        of Grafton, and his heirs male for ever, with the right of fencing out
        the deer and all commonable cattle, during nine years after cutting. The
        timber is reserved to the Crown, and fourteen parishes have a right of
        commonage for such cattle and horses (none of sheep or pigs) as they can
        support in winter. It would be natural to suppose such a right of more
        consequence than it really is: in 1789 there were sound, by driving the
        forest, which is now done every year in three drives of Haselborough,
        Sholebrook, and Hanger, no more than 470 head of cattle and horses,
        which shews of what little value the commonage upon such a vast extent
        of land amounts to.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The commissioners for managing the landed
        revenue of the Crown are supposed to be employed at present on their
        report concerning this forest. I did not find, upon enquiry, that it had
        been viewed and examined by any person with so much care and accuracy as
        at all likely to preclude the few observations I have to make on it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The ideas of these gentlemen may be pretty well
        collected from their seventh report, which, though on Salcey forest,
        more immediately has some remarks which are applied to that of
        Whittlewood; these forests are but a few miles from each other. At page
        9, of that report, it is remarked, that in James I. time there were in
        that of Salcey,</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">&quot;So that the timber fit for the navy was
        little more than <small><sup>1</sup> /<sub>10</sub> </small>of what it
        was in 1608, which small stock of timber remaining in 1783, is not
        accounted for by the selling of timber in the present century,
        -extraordinary diminution !&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">As Whittlewood forest is an object, from its
        extent, of much greater importance than Salcey forest, it is to be hoped
        that these gentlemen will pay it another sort of attention, for the
        above remark is dashed off in a manner much too hasty to give the least
        satisfaction to any inquisitive mind. So far from there appearing to be
        any extraordinary diminution of oak, there does not in the above
        particulars appear to have been any diminution equal to what has taken
        place on all the private properties of the kingdom. Here is, according
        to their own account, 11,000 loads of oak, and near 9000 ashes; these
        may amount to a total very different from that of a tenth. But it is
        remarkable that there are now 11,000 oak trees, and in 1608 only 15,000,
        thus the quantity of timber has been much more lessened than the number
        of the trees: this seems to prove that in modern times the oaks have
        been left far too thick, which has preserved <em>number</em> at the
        expence of <em>quantity</em> ; and I am the readier to make this remark,
        because in numerous rides, which I took through Whittlewood forest,
        observing the oaks particularly, I noted them to be lest vastly too
        thick, I mean in those coppices, in which government have not yet
        cleared all the timber of a good dimension, and which are all the
        coppices, except those from 16 to 251 years growth; in many coppices
        indeed the trees stand so thick, that I am confident the quantity of
        timber has been much lessened by it. It is not uncommon to see five or
        six trees with their heads all joining; but to have great timber, there
        ought to be a free current of air around the head of each; I surely need
        nor remark that when the view is navy timber, the size of the trees
        should not be sacrificed to the purpose of keeping a great number.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">When the improvements that have taken place
        since 1608, the immense increase of population, which must have thronged
        all the adjacent villages, and consequently the much greater number of
        cattle, turned by common right on the forest, are well considered, the
        decrease of timber here marked will, so far from appearing <em>extraordinary</em>
        , be thought remarkably small.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">I am sorry to have occasion to observe, that
        these gentlemen do not seem averse from seizing opportunities of finding
        fault even upon points much too trifling to demand notice: at page 11,
        they say, &quot;the stools or roots of trees felled, which
        unquestionably belong to the Crown, are here taken by the keepers; the
        value of them when dug up, is from 1 s. to 5s. each.&quot; - &quot;to
        any one, who considers the natural tendency of such a system of
        management, it cannot be surprising that any property whatever should
        not prove very productive.&quot; - When the reader is informed that at
        least half the value of these roots must be paid for the labour of
        grubbing them, I believe it will be generally agreed that by far the
        best application of them is to give them away, so as to make it the
        interest of some resident persons to take care that these roots should
        be grubbed. And why? Not for securing to the Crown the paltry value of
        6d. or 1s. but for having such spaces of earth very well broken, to
        receive acorns that may produce future trees, an object, with a view to
        timber, worth attending to, whereas that of the mere value of the stump
        is contemptible, and unworthy of the piece of censure that is tagged to
        it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">To mark this more strongly, I may observe that
        these roots are not cleared away till after the second year; and where
        only it has been seen, that they would not shoot out again. In this
        case, every intelligent person will perceive that in woods of two years
        growth the damage, which would accrue from the carting into them to get
        these roots, would amount to fifty times the value of them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">In some particulars the commissioners appear to
        have been too ready to listen to insufficient information; p. 10. they
        are informed, &quot;that some of the browse trees (shredded or pollarded
        ones, trimmed periodically for the deer to browse on) are very large,
        sound, and fit for the service of the navy:&quot; in consequence of
        this, above 100 were ordered to be cut in Salcey forest, none of which,
        or scarcely any, were sound. Pollarded or trimmed trees sound, and fit
        for the navy ! - Whoever will examine such trees, which I have done many
        thousands, they will be found either decayed from that destructive
        management, or the texture of the timber so short and brittle from
        knots, as to be of little worth for primary uses.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">In the following passage, these gentlemen do
        not seem to have considered their subject with the requisite attention;
        p. 13. &quot;It is the concurring information which we have hitherto
        received of a gradual decrease in the quantity of growing timber, the
        prospect of a scarcity, and the danger of depending upon other countries
        for the support of our navy, which alone could induce us to recommend
        that government should undertake what we know to be so difficult as the
        management, protection, and improvement of woods and timber.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Now it is the scarcity, and consequent value,
        of wood and timber, which form precisely the reason why government ought
        not to attempt this; which will be sufficiently clear to those who
        reflect that wood is destroyed by robbery and depredation exactly in
        proportion to its scarcity. One hundred and seventy years ago it was so
        plentiful, that even government itself, with all its waste and
        negligence, was adequate to the preservation of that which at present
        cannot be well preserved by the fostering care and attention of the
        immediate eye of the owner. In future, wood of all kinds will grow
        dearer and dearer, and at such a time to recommend to government to
        attempt the farming of oak can, in common sense, mean no more than the
        establishment of groups of officers to pocket salaries, for doing what
        is well known will never be done at all. Will the plundering poor regard
        forests, because the public property? Will not officers, in future,
        abuse their trusts, as well as officers in the past and present time?
        And will government, in time to come, be able to do what it never was
        able to do in times past-be careful and ??conomical in the management of
        land?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">But these gentlemen complain of the scarcity of
        oak. This complaint, as an argument, has, I conceive, no foundation
        whatever. If by it we are only to understand, that the kingdom having
        doubled or trebled its population,-that corn, and mutton, and beef, now
        occupy the land which once was incumbered by wood,-that hedge rows,
        instead of spreading two or three rods into every field, now are
        confined to the quick-set and the ditch,-if these plain facts only are
        in contemplation, the question may be dismissed in a moment, for all the
        world knows, that in proportion as a kingdom improves, wood <em>must</em>
        lessen: we have just so much reason to rejoice that wood is scarce, as
        cultivation is more valuable in the scale of national prosperity than
        waste and forest. But if by this complaint, and consequent
        recommendation, any thing is implied, touching the price of timber being
        too high-or that the scarcity is greater than might have been
        expected-or that any steps should be taken to arrest the natural
        progress of improvement, by confining certain spots, by authority, to
        this production, which would otherwise submit in their turn to that
        amelioration which time carries throughout the kingdom;-in this case the
        proposition is a serious and a very mischievous one. Oak may be bought
        of other countries. but industrious men, fed by better products, cannot
        be bought. Of whom, nautically speaking; have you any apprehension, if
        not of France? But France is more <em>denuded</em> of oak (to use a <em>Johnsonian</em>
        phrase) than England itself, and builds her ships of war of foreign
        wood: if she therefore must go abroad for timber, surely we may do the
        fame, on terms as advantageous.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">But to all the purposes of fair argument, I
        contend that oak is not <em>dear</em> ; and that all the scarcity
        (supposing there is any) that is feared, has proceeded from its being
        too <em>cheap</em> . There are few oaks in Great Britain, on a soil good
        enough to produce navy timber, but what at 150 or 200 years old, have
        cost the propietors of the land, and the nation, the double of what they
        are worth. Apply an acre of land now to oak, and an adjoining acre to
        corn or grass, and which in 100 or 200 years will have paid most? The
        result (not difficult to calculate) would shew, that oak timber instead
        of being <em>scarce</em> , is not at half its fair price. Rough, waste,
        and barbarous countries, are the proper nurseries of timber: it is a
        produce inconsistent with a high degree of cultivation and improvement.
        To complain of its scarcity, is to reprobate national prosperity; and to
        propose, by any restrictions, such an application of the soil, is to
        prefer a product that pays 20s. to another that would yield 5l. Such
        speculations are very proper dreams for commissioners, who apply those
        years to making <em>reports</em> , which might be employed in dividing
        and felling forests,-but forbid it, policy, that they should be adopted
        by the legistature !</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The plain result of all such enquiries will be,
        that for the production of any commodity whatever, there is but one
        system of policy adequate; to leave it entirely to private industry, and
        private views; and to let the only encouragement be a good price. In my
        opinion, there is no other want of timber in this country than what
        there ought to be, from the right preference given to other productions.
        If it was proper to encourage a greater growth, which can hardly be,
        there is but one way to do it, and that is, to raise the price
        considerably;-6l. a load would not be adequate.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Whatever decision may, in the opinion of the
        public, be given to such enquiries, there can be no doubt of the
        propriety of converting all such forests to private property. I have
        already described the treble right there is in this of Whittlewood. The
        timber the Crown's: the underwood the Duke's, and the right of commonage
        upon the soil. This intermixture is equally mischievous to both. The
        timber suffers greatly; the young oaks, of only nine years growth, are
        eaten up, barked, or trampled on equally with the underwood, so that
        none could escape if it was not for the thickets of blackthorn that her-
        and there protect one; nor is this the only grievance, the timber is
        left so late in the coppices, as I saw to the end of July, when there
        seemed to be at least two months carting to do, that the teams must have
        destroyed many young standils, as well as done great damage to the
        underwood; it is sufficiently clear that better management would rectify
        this abuse. The depredations of the cattle and deer are not so easily
        guarded against; the growth of nine years is little protection against
        them, for I saw the bark eaten off plants that one would have thought
        secure; but cattle used to the forest have the art of bending down a
        bough by the neck till within reach of the soot, then treading on it
        till they have stripped it. Nothing can remedy such mischief, but making
        every property distinct; assigning to the parishes some portion adequate
        to their commonage; to the Duke of Grafton another, equal to his rights;
        and selling (not reserving), the remainder. In the division and sale of
        the Crown Lands, I conceive the great object is their conversion to the
        most profitable productions of which they are capable: provided they are
        cultivated to the best advantage, it is of very little consequence to
        the state in whose hands they are found.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Should, however, the legislature listen to
        propositions that have only the production of timber in view, then it
        will be necessary in all such cases to transfer the Crown's right to its
        portion of the forest, on the division, to some private person (the
        ranger or principal proprietor), under covenant to deliver, after a
        certain number of years, a specified number of loads of oak timber,
        annually, for the use of the navy. Difficulties would arise in the
        method of doing this, and officers with a constant inspection must of
        necessity be continued in order to fee that the succession of oak was
        always preserved; a sad business at best, and never to be depended on
        satisfactory y by either party. Under the present administration of the
        forests, or under that which is now hinted at, or any other but the mere
        attention of private interest, it is probable that the royal navy never
        did, and never will receive a tree worth 10l. that did not cost the
        nation 100l. So very incomplete is every project, but that plain and
        simple one of depending for the supply of oak on the price that will be
        given for it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">But to return-The soil of this forest, and of
        the country in general is well adapted to the growth<sup><a shape="rect" href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=Young&amp;c_id=5&amp;cpub_id=0#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title>4</a>
        </sup>of most sorts of wood; and the copses, of which the Duke of
        Grafton has a great extent, are, notwithstanding the feeding of the
        deer, and the common cattle, valuable. The mode of selling them and the
        payment form the circumstance of a very eligible property. Nothing can
        be better adapted to save trouble than the methods used. <em>Washes</em>
        or glades are cut across the copse, at certain distances, and laid in a
        row, from which to judge of the contents of the whole. Wood-valuers are
        employed, who walk in the wash on each side of every cut, and note in
        their <em>view-book</em> , the value of each <em>cut</em> , that is each
        space of 10 poles long and 2 broad. From habit they acquire such
        dexterity that their valuation very rarely occasions any appeal from
        their judgment; and as much employment as an object to them of interest,
        honesty is their best policy, so that no suspicions are entertained of
        their integrity. The whole copse being thus marked into <em>cuts</em>
        and numbered and valued, every purchaser can be supplied with a lot to
        the value he wants; and the money is paid before he takes the wood away.
        They are cut, at the expence of the purchaser, at 21 years growth; and
        the value is various, according to the accidental depredations of the
        deer and cattle, the thickness of the plant, the soil, &amp;. but it may
        be stated at from 2l. 10s. to 6l. an acre. The value of such an estate
        to the proprietor is very great indeed; for here is not the hazard of a
        bad tenant in a century; no farm-houses, barns, or stables to repair,
        nor any tythe to pay on the produce; and the value of the crop rises
        pretty regularly every 20 years. In Mr. Cape's examination, in the <em>Seventh
        Report</em> , this rise is stated to be one-third in the memory of a man
        of about 50: and he remarks that it is still increafmg. But great as the
        value of such an estate is at present, the improvement of excluding deer
        and cattle altogether would be a capital one; as appears by some copses
        where they are entirely shut out; and the growth and thickness of such
        are duly proportioned to that circumstance.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The great value of woods in this country, will
        appear from a state of the sales of underwood and timber, for three
        years in certain woods of the Duke of Grafton's private property, which
        his Grace favoured me with, and which I shall insert here, as the
        management of the timber is not common, and merits considerable
        attention. It is to be noted that in these woods trees will not come to
        a great size, yet are very profitable to a certain growth, provided they
        are left with judgment, taking out all such as will not thrive well;
        these copses are cut at 13 years growth, and the timber according to its
        thriving, at two to five <em>falls</em> of the underwood, that is from
        the age of 26 to 65 years; beyond which age it does not pay for
        standing.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">A remarkable instance of the great produce of
        wood occurred upon the Ascot inclosure; 14 acres, a corner of the field
        over-run with rubbish, had so bad an appearance that none of the
        proprietors wished to have the allotment; the duke of Grafton did not
        object, and had it; it was carefully fenced, and half of it cut in
        eleven years; the seven acres sold for 63l. or 9l. per acre, or above
        I6s. per acre per annum, the first cutting, with a certainty of a
        confiderable improvement as the copse thickens and is preserved.</font></p>

        given of the great profit of woodland <em>to the landlord</em> , must
        not induce any one to think that the national interest is equally
        concerned. To him the <em>gross produce</em> , and the <em>net profit</em>
        , are nearly the same thing; and 20s. from wood is better to him than
        20s. from a farm; but the difference is immense to the public. The farm
        that gives 20s. rent gives from 12s. to 20s. more in profit to the
        farmer; from 20s. to 30s. and even 40s. to the poor in labour, besides
        the support of artizans, &amp;. All woods, therefore, in the eye of the
        public, should be considered as a species of waste; a productive waste,
        it is true, but not by three-fourths so productive as corn and grass.</font></p>

        and convenient farmyards, well inclosed with stone walls, and surrounded
        with cattle-sheds, properly disposed over his great farm for
        convenience, and every thing in that tight repair, and excellent order,
        which is as pleasant to the eye of a spectator, as it is useful to the
        interest of a proprietor. His great crop of hay this year, when
        tolerable ones are so scarce, proves how well he manages his grass
        lands; and nothing can be better or neater made than his hay stacks; if
        his neighbours would copy this circumstance, it would not add a little
        to the beauty of every landscape; but at present they do not seem to
        think much difference of form necessary for a dunghill or a stack. Such
        a spectacle is much more to me than all the lawns, waters, and houses in
        England. I may however remark, for the use of such as love <em>seeing
        places</em> , that there is one feature at Wakefield Lodge equal to most
        in the kingdom; a lawn of delicious verdure, even in this drought, which
        may spread 500 acres, sloping to a water, of which it is sufficient to
        say, that it was formed by Brown; scattered groups of trees chequer the
        scene, and all surrounded, in every direction, by the shade of a forest
        impervious to the eye; not the poverty of a limit planted to <em>screen</em>
        and deceive, but the deep recesses, the umbrageous gloom, in which you
        may wander without boundary, and roam as in the wilds of America, did
        not numerous ridings cut in strait lines, and very neatly laid to grass,
        facilitate a passage to every part<sup><a shape="rect" href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=Young&amp;c_id=5&amp;cpub_id=0#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title>6</a></sup></font></p>

        </sup>Mentioning Mr. Roper, reminds me of an experiment he has made on
        cow-grass. In the spring of 1789, he sowed part of a field with red
        clover, and the rest of it with cow-grass <em>bought from <a name="pn_117" href="http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=596">Aylesbury</a>
        in Buckinghamshire</em> , with barley after turnips. Both here mown for
        hay in 1790, the common clover giving the greatest produce, and rather
        the most after-grass. This year, 1791, both are fed, and the cow grass
        has yielded vastly more than the clover, and of a better quality. They
        are apparently of a decidedly different habit and quality; the cow grass
        spreads more on the ground; thicker; the stalk is solid, not pipy, and
        it does not run equally to blossom. The stipula of the <em>trifolium
        alpefire</em> , is lancolated; of the <em>pratense</em> aristated; which
        I have been taught to esteem the decisive difference, as well as the
        running roots of the former: now, to all common appearance, these plants
        are the same, for 1 do not put much faith in a doubtful appearance of
        solidity in the stalk. Will some of my botanical readers pay some
        attention to this question, and give to plain farmers, the
        characteristical difference of these plants; and should there be none,
        which was the opinion of the late Rev. Mr. Laurents, a very able
        botanist, will they at least explain these certainly distinct qualities,
        of which duration is the most material.</font></p>

        </sup>I measured Wakes oak in the forest, which is the ruins of a noble

        </sup>They have an economical practice, of burning lime on the kiln at

        </sup>Such ridings answer the purposes for which they were made, and
        therefore it would be ridiculous to find fault with them, but to me they
        bring down the imposing effect of the forest idea, to the decoration of
        a park; if grass is introduced, it should be in broken and irregular
        lines; to be lost in the sinuosities of such, would be a merit adapted
        to the extent and wildness of the scene; a man should be able to find
        his way in a park, but not in a forest.</font></p>
