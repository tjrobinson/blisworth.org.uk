        one require historic comment.&nbsp; The somewhat shallow holllows which
        appear partly regrown with weeds were actually made in 1942/3 when RTH
        came to the these fields in a war effort project to raise iron ore for
        the northern furnaces.&nbsp; In the one year of work this long gully
        (see next) was all that was dug probably because they had come with an
        insufficiently large digger to remove a massive thickness of limestone
        overburden.
        <p>The date of this photograph is 1957 or even slightly earlier because
        it shows the establishment of a large machine that has started work
        extending the gully, re-opening the mine.&nbsp; It has done so behind the scene
        that has been photographed, in the direction of the railway,
        visible below, which acquires a branch.&nbsp; Tonks maps will explain.</p>
        <p>Later on the gully is renewed in its full length so that at the
        lower end the machines approach the village quite closely.&nbsp; The
        gullies are worked out towards the south-west, ie. right for this
        viewpoint.</p>
