        <p align="left"><b>40-01a</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Early on the morning of Sunday the
        25th Sept., an aspect of Blisworth's heritage was re-enacted - that of
        &quot;legging&quot; boats through the tunnel, being the means of
        propulsion in times before steam.&nbsp; The event was organised by the
        Horseboating Society (formed in 2001, website - <a href="http://www.horseboating.org.uk">www.horseboating.org.uk</a>).&nbsp;
        This picture, taken by a society member, shows the preparation of the butty
        &quot;Sunny Valley&quot; at Stoke Bruerne. 
        <p align="left">The society and all those who enjoyed the event are indebted to the owner and the sponsors
        who made &quot;Sunny Valley&quot; available for their use.&nbsp; It featured in the 1944
        Ealing Studios classic film &quot;Painted Boats&quot; in which it was legged
        through the tunnel.&nbsp; Legging re-enactments have been seldom since
        then through Blisworth Tunnel - which makes the members all the keener!

        against the
        tunnel wall by a couple of men (or, at least, usually men).&nbsp; They have to lie
        on fairly wide planks (known as &quot;wings&quot;) to extend the width of the boat because the tunnel is wide
        enough for boats to pass one another.&nbsp; When two legged boats met in
        the tunnel, the leggers on both had to quickly get up and stow the wings within the width of their boats and then return to the task when
        the boats had passed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, a couple from the Horseboating
        Society are preparing to start the &quot;leg&quot; from Stoke to Blisworth.&nbsp; They were not

        a small group of villagers, taking the historic route that the horses
        would have taken; up &quot;Boat Lane&quot; in Stoke parish, along the
        toll road and down the short ramp in Blisworth.

        propelling
        the boat, pushing hard enough to avoid the wing from rubbing
        against the wall of the tunnel and remaining safely centred on the wing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the straps visible in the pictures
        are <i> not</i> a means for securing
        the legger to the wing. The legger can just lie there because there is
        little tendency to slide across the wing as long as gentle progress is
        all that is desired - typically, at just over 1 mph.</p>
        <p>Compare that with conditions in the early 19th century when boats
        were legged at higher speeds and when life could be &quot;expended
        with less conscience&quot;.&nbsp; It seems legging was hazardous then; a

        <p>&quot;My broken leg of 2001 still gives me problems. I did get pains

        <p>&quot;The walk back was probably more tiring than the passage through
        the tunnel,
        which we all thoroughly enjoyed and would happily have done again. A
        very successful day, and thanks are due to all concerned&quot;.</p>
        <p>&quot;The legging was not arduous. It was the months of e-mails and
        phone calls about arrangements and permissions that were wearying&quot;.</p>

        <p><b>40-07</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Bonny
        was arriving at the north tunnel portal and was harnessed up.&nbsp; Sue
        Day is pictured here giving a short presentation to explain the workings
        of the harness.&nbsp; It is designed to convey the load evenly to both
        sides of a padded collar.&nbsp; A rope (traditionally known as a trace) runs backwards from the collar on
        both sides.&nbsp; One of these, colourfully decorated, can be
        seen in the upper picture.&nbsp; The ropes are attached to the ends of a
        spreader bar (which is about three foot wide) behind the horse and the
        tow rope is attached to the centre of that bar.&nbsp; By this means, the
        load is evenly distributed (please refer to the black and white picture
        for clarification).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Along the sides of the horse, the ropes are held out by means of
        being passed through eyes (wooden bobbins) so that no chafing can occur.&nbsp; In the
        upper picture, one of the extensions by the flank, which carries an eye, can
        just be made out.

      <td width="1262" height="510"><b>40-08 </b>&nbsp; A long rope is generally
        used in order to minimise the force which could pull the horse on the
        tow path towards the water.&nbsp; The rope is attached to the boat
        centrally and some distance back from its bow.&nbsp; This measure
        ensures that the tension on the rope has little steering effect on the
        boat.&nbsp; Horse and boat are pictured here
        rounding the last bend before Mill Bridge in Blisworth.
        <p>The sun decided to come out at this leisurely stage in the
        re-enactment.&nbsp; On occasions when horses meet on the path, one of the
        towropes
        would be raised with the use of a long forked pole so that a horse with its boat
        could pass underneath it.&nbsp; However, the traditional way of dealing
        with this problem was to stop one of the horses at the correct moment
        and allow its boat to continue to drift.&nbsp; Their long towrope then
        sank into the water and was tidied on the footpath so that the other
        horse, with its boat, could continue <i>over</i> the lowered rope.&nbsp;
        If a horse and boat needed to pass a moored boat then the towrope
        would be dealt with manually.</p>
