        an Honourary Fellowship of Nene University College for his unique legacy
        to the County of Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Through a lifetime of

        and customs of the people of Blisworth.&nbsp; The village is indebted to
        him for his work.&nbsp; It wasn't until after he had died that something
        was done to apply order to his collection and publish some of the
        material.
