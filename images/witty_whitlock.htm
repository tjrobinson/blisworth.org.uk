<p style="padding-left: 15; padding-right: 200"><font color="#000080">Witty
retired from duties of Sexton n 1956 after 35 years of devoted service. He was
also a village craftsman and carpenter - the two oak book cupboards and the oak
processional cross are examples of his good workmanship.&nbsp; He was a
colourful character and his escapades and 'fireside' stories will become
legendary.&nbsp; He was the last of the village boys to receive their education
at the Old Grammar School in Courteenhall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Written by George Freeston 10th October 1970.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 200"><u><font color="#000080">Whitlock's
Bell</font></u></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 200"><font color="#000080">Whitlock,
I love to hear your bell<br>
Take lead and tell<br>
That God is calling to his own<br>
From the grey stone<br>
of Church and aisle<br>
To come and meet with Him awhile.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 200"><font color="#000080">Just three
score years have fallen white<br>
On Belfry height<br>
Yet with unfaltering step you climb<br>
to check the time,<br>
That all may know<br>
Whether their clock is fast or slow.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 200"><font color="#000080">Your bell
should have a tongue of gold<br>
She oft has told<br>
of Christmas and Eastertide<br>
Christ and his bride<br>
For God to enter at her gates.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 200"><font color="#000080">One final
note - her very soul<br>
Speaks when you toll.<br>
So, William, may we hear at last<br>
When life has past,<br>
God's peace ring out o'er human wrong<br>
This evensong.</font></p>

the Rev. Howard Ussher (Baptist Minister at Blisworth) when Witty was 60 - ie.
1933.</font></p>
