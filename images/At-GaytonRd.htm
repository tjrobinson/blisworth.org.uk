        the north) so that the cutting for the new road can be completed from

        Road.&nbsp; The swathe of land to be used by the new road, with its
        cutting, is already marked out and will include the line of the parish
        boundary (between Blisworth and Gayton) which in fact coincides with the
        high hedge on the right of the picture.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hedge is interesting in that it stands on a bed
        of ironstone.&nbsp; The fields on both sides have a lower level because
        the ironstone has been opencast mined in the 19th century.&nbsp; It was
        mined on both sides by different contractors, neither of which dared to
        obliterate the parish boundary.</p>

        been removed and a boundary fence, which is recognisable today, has been
        established to the right.&nbsp; A large pile of top-soil, to be returned
        to farmers, is being collected towards the left of the picture, which
        has been taken from the middle of the
        &quot;U&quot; road.</p>
        <p>At about 15 metres to the left of the slight &quot;crest&quot; in the

        <p>The picture <a href="full&#32;width.jpg">linked here</a> is a view from
        the &quot;U&quot; road where most of the excavation has been completed.
        It shows the preparation of foundations for the &quot;boxes&quot; at
        both ends of the bridge and the foundations for the concrete post in the
        middle. I was assisted by the Chief Engineer (at the time, working for
        Galliford) whose name has slipped my memory because it has taken me too
        long to get round to posting this new detail. Once the boxes and posts
        are created, shuttering is created out of wood, mounted on a complex of
        supportive scaffolding, and the entire bed of the bridge is poured
        continuously over many hours to create a solid monolith of concrete.
        Steel cages are buried in the pouring to provide rigidity. The sequence
        for this process is shown in the following three pictures, taken by the
        chief engineer:</p>

        road is still in use, at the time this picture was taken.&nbsp; It bypasses the place where the bridge is to be
        built.&nbsp; This is looking south from the &quot;U&quot; road.&nbsp; The level of the new
        A43 road is
        established and has become a useful means of access for contractor's vehicles to
        the works.&nbsp; The high reinforced concrete wall, with concrete
        &quot;wings&quot;, will eventually both retain soil and support one end
        of the bridge.&nbsp; The hollow occupied by a yellow dumper-truck will
        be entirely back filled with earth.&nbsp; To the left of the picture, the line of the bridge
        is already established.&nbsp; There is another winged wall being built
        on the other side of the new road making the whole job quite space
        consuming - hence the considerable diversion needed for the Gayton Road
        on the &quot;U&quot; road.
        <p>The wall and the wings need substantial concrete foundations and the
        box shaped excavation seen in the next picture will carry one of many
        enormous blocks of reinforced concrete needed for the foundations.</p>

        foundation preparations for the bridge and, at the top, a section of the
        &quot;U&quot; road.&nbsp; Note the geology - the top few metres is sandy
        and contains ironstone, the lower level is blue clay which goes down
        to well below the level of the River Nene.
