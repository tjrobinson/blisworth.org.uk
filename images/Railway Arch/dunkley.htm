<font size="3" color="#000080">Having spent much of my life recording the
buildings of my native Blisworth, and the lives and times of its inhabitants,
one of the things which stands out is the way trades were passed on from father
to son over many generations. One example is the Dunkleys (or Dunckleys),
carpenters and jobbing builders for three centuries and more in the village, and
neighbouring places such as Gayton, Milton Malsor and Towcester. I came across
them in the parish records and through their initials cut in wood and stone,
often in unlikely places such as the roof of the church, where they left their
hand and foot-prints, often initialled and dated, scored into the leads when they did
repairs. The inset shows Richard Dunkley's mark dated 1826 at the age of
approximately 19 years.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">In the early and mid-nineteenth century there
were several branches of the family in Blisworth, from which one individual
emerged who was able to seize the exceptional opportunities offered by the times
to build up a business on a scale that went far beyond that possible for any of
his forebears. This was Richard Dunkley, who died in the rectory at Alby,
Norfolk, in 1886, aged 79. There is the likelihood that Richard Dunkley was
mentored by his senior, <a href="../Stokerd02.htm#wills">George Wills</a>, at a
time (1930s) when both
were associated with Blisworth and engaged in building
the Stoneworks house and office for the Duke of Grafton. The most obvious sign of his early success in life is
<a href="../loundes.htm">The Loundes</a>, a splendid six-bedroom cottage in the
early Victorian Gothic manner, with steeply pitched roofs and very ornate barge-boarding,
set in a one and a half acre garden, which he built for himself and his family
in 1846. An early picture of the house, which was <i>then</i> probably called The Lowndes <a href="../Loundes/photographs.htm">is
shown here</a>.&nbsp;Dunkley lived at the Loundes for most of his career,
undoubtedly commuting by train to his various projects.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080"><i>George Freeston wrote:&nbsp;</i> &quot;Another Blisworth landmark of his, which no one who passes through the
village can miss, is the fine stone <a href="../Arch.htm">railway arch</a> under
which the old Towcester to Northampton road passes. Tradition has it that the
contractor who first worked on it in the building of the London and Birmingham
Railway in the 1830s failed to do the job properly, and Dunkley took it over. In
consequence he established a link with what became the London &amp; North
Western Railway Company that was to prove very profitable to him.&quot;<br>
This last sentence is an unsubstantiated claim that <i>may have been</i> exactly
what happened. The arch went through two designs; a five arch
&quot;viaduct&quot; first and then a solid and frankly more stable stone and
brick single arch. We can assume that the railway company must have juggled with
these designs well before the completion of the main line. A railway company
specification for Contract 1F includes the work to be done to establish over
seven bridges and the substantial Blisworth Cutting (aka. Roade cutting) and the
building of the embankments at Blisworth - all of this to be completed in 1835 -
1837. So Richard
Dunkley's success in getting the subcontract for the arch must have been in 1836 at the
latest and possibly because a previous contractor (William Hughes) had gone
bankrupt. Richard Dunkley was then about 29 and had possibly completed only the Stoneworks
Building for the Duke of Grafton this, I suspect, was probably with <a href="../Stokerd02.htm#wills">George
Wills</a>, many years his senior, overseeing him. Years after the arch work
there are both G Wills and R Dunkley living at the Stoneworks as shown by the
1841 census (a portion <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Stoneworks%201841.xls">provided here</a>). We
need to comb the company records for hard evidence before we may properly
conclude that Dunkley was the &quot;lead&quot; builder of the arch. First
impressions on this is that by around 1861 he had &quot;made his mark&quot;, as
is clear from brief details of his career in paragraphs below, and was
considered a reliable contractor in the railways building world. Earlier he was
regarded with caution as his work had included only small scale items as
indicated in the passage below from John Gough's 1970s book. Nothing more has
been found circa November and December 2015 by Barry Taylor who has been
scouting for relevant records at Kew PRO.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150; padding-right: 150" align="center"><font color="#0000FF"><b>April
1856</b>&nbsp; &quot;Dunkley had been an unsuccessful tenderer some years before for the construction of the Northampton station on the Northampton &amp; Peterborough line
- the Bridge Street station. He had done other work for the Company, and the questional issue
here appears merely to be about the scale".</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">The more noteworthy part of Dunkley's career
is reviewed below but, evidently, his reputation had become established with the building of the Blisworth to
Peterborough line and with the completion of <a href="../BliswHotel.htm">a hotel</a> adjacent
to a new station for Blisworth. Blisworth was to become an important local junction in the
railway system. Besides the hotel, many acres of
pleasure grounds were later laid out, which became a very popular venue on summer
evenings, weekends and holidays for much of the rest of the century. In addition
to the railway company, involved in these developments were the 4th Duke of
Grafton, the landowner, and Thomas Shaw of the Angel Hotel, Northampton. Shaw
was the leading stagecoach operator before the coming of the railway, and he
became the landlord of the Blisworth Hotel. Pickering Phipps, the Northampton
brewer and later a iron-mining businessman, took on the hotel on a 79-year lease. As well as his own business
abilities, Richard Dunkley's connection with these men and their interests, also the
Stephensons and the Duke of Grafton, were undoubtedly
the reasons why Dunkley was able to make the transition from village builder to
large scale contractor. Quite how large his enterprise became did not become apparent until I came
across his newspaper obituary of 1886 - see the &quot;Building News&quot; obituary below. Dunkley's operations stretched far beyond
the Blisworth and Northampton area.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">Very little is known about Richard
Dunkley. For example, no record of his baptism has yet been found. From the
details given with his obituary, he was born at sometime between August 15, 1806
and August 13, 1807. He was
presumably born in 1807 to parents Meshack and Elizabeth as may be judged by
family references. One theory is that the transcripted records contain an error, <a href="BMB-Dunkley.jpg">see ? mark</a> where (<b>B</b>)urial
was mistaken for (<b>C</b>)hristening ie. <b>B</b>irth), and so his birth day
would have been March 2nd. An examination of the micro-fiched records of the
original records shows it is obvious that a&nbsp; Richard Dunckley <a href="RD-burial.jpg">really
was recorded buried</a> on Mar 2, 1807 as burial and baptisms records were kept
on separate pages of the ledger. The extended Dunkley family of Blisworth
certainly included at least two Richards who could have died at that time. The
baptisms records, however, show no entry for a Richard Dunkley within the
appropriate period. It
is possible that, instead, the Baptist church recorded the name-giving and in those days
there was no law that required a record must be made with the Anglican church.
That a family might switch to the Baptist church at that time seems reasonable
in view of probably chaos generated by the absence of and no doubt the gossip
about the <a href="../Articles/Ambrosse-2.htm">Rev. Ambrose</a> in 1807. Chaos
could have reigned over the maintenance of records as well and we are left with
nothing definite.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">In 1827 his marriage to Lucy Carter of
Blisworth parish is recorded, he signing the register Richard Dunckley. Again,
there is neither record of Lucy's age nor the date of her birth in the records.
Of their off-spring, the parish
registers record the deaths of no less than three infant daughters between 1832
and 1835 and a son aged 9 in 1837, but Frances, Caroline, Elizabeth, Lucy Emily
and Richard Henry survived to adulthood.&nbsp; The 1841 census places him at the
Stoneworks, Blisworth.&nbsp; This is interesting since it puts him, while
already an established builder, in touch with the Grafton stone quarrying
enterprise at a time after the involvement of <a href="../Articles/Stone-works.html">John
Roper</a>.</font></p>
      <p><img src="puckle.jpg" height="347" align="left" width="300">
      <font size="3" color="#000080">Dunkley was a churchman, and two of his
daughters married clergymen: Lucy the Rev Herbert Price, later rector of
Normanton, Derbyshire, and Elizabeth the <a href="../ch-groups.htm#puckle"> Rev Edwin
Puckle</a>, curate of Blisworth, shown inset at the time of his MA graduation in
      Oxford 1858,
who became rector of Alby, Norfolk. Their sister, Frances, (then aged 44), was
unmarried in 1881, and Caroline married Richard Prothero Jones, a mineral agent.
The Census Enumerator's Book for 1881 records that Henry, then aged 30, was also
married, with a child. Dunkley was a Freemason, and served as Worshipful Master
of Pomfret Lodge, Northampton (No. 360) in 1865-6. Apart from inferring continuing
connections with the Railway Company, the Duke of Grafton, the Church, and
Pickering Phipps from the various projects he executed, we know very little else
about him, other than that his obituary records that most of his contracts were
carried out for over 40 years by Mr J Brown, builder, of Northampton, assisted
by his son, Mr W I Brown, who was Borough Surveyor in 1886. Dunkley also
      developed an association with the well-known Northampton architect,
      E.M.Law. We may also hazard
that Dunkley's politics were Conservative.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">In 1851, a vast amount of <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm"> ironstone was discovered</a> in Northamptonshire.  As a result of this the London &amp; North Western Railway, (L&amp;NWR), decided to capitalize on this
occurrence by proposing a new railway line between Northampton and Market Harborough.  This in itself would open up more of the countryside for rail travel by providing a link between the lines from Rugby to Stamford, and Blisworth to Peterborough.&nbsp;
The contract to build the line was eventually awarded to Richard Dunkley of
Blisworth on the 23rd July 1856, five years after the original proposal.&nbsp; The completion date for the line was given as the
1st June 1858.  However, due to unforeseen difficulties, one of which was a landslide in March 1858 at the north face of Kelmarsh tunnel, the line was not finally approved for public use until the
15th February 1859, with the first passenger train running the following day.<br>
The line was originally built as a single track to begin with, but as the volume of traffic increased, it was decided that a double track was needed.  This gave rise to the unusual
sight of both Oxendon tunnel, (462 yards long), and Kelmarsh tunnel, (322 yards long), having
separate bores for the northbound and southbound lines.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">In addition to the buildings in Blisworth
already mentioned there are (or were until recently) plenty of examples of his
work in the immediate vicinity and an interesting resume of his work in his
obituary given below. In the eighteen sixties and early seventies he
built new schools at Collingtree, Greens Norton, Sywell, Paulespury, Tiffield
and Roade, several with the bell-towers and wrought-iron weather vanes which
Dunkley favoured. He built a new rectory at Roade (now demolished), and
Collingtree Grange for Pickering Phipps in 1875, to the design of the
Northampton architect, E F Law. He executed a major revision to Pottesbury
Church in c. 1848.&nbsp; In Northampton itself he carried out many
projects in the three decades from 1850. The Corn Exchange in the Market Place
was his work, as was the General Post Office, Abington Street (1868), the New
Cattle Market and its roads, new breweries for Messrs Phipps &amp; Co, and
Messrs Phillips and Manning. He took down the old Town Hall, and was much
involved in construction work needed in the expansion of the town, including the
Kettering Road Reservoirs, and the roads and culverts on the new Kingsley Park
estate. Amongst the new institutions of Victorian Northampton, he was
responsible for the additions to St Andrew's Hospital, and the west wing, school
and chapel of the Convent of Notre Dame in Abington Street.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">Not all these have survived recent 'urban
renewal', though many will remember them. Nor have Dunkley projects such as the
Northampton to Market Harborough line survived modern railway rationalisation.
What is revealing from the detail in Richard Dunkley's obituary is the scale and
scope of his work further away from the Northampton area. He did a great deal of
work for London &amp; Birmingham, and later the London &amp; North Western
Railway Company, building most of the railway workshops at Wolverton, and also
much workers' housing and the Mechanics' Institute in that town, and he erected
seventy-two railway workers' cottages at nearby Stantonbury. The whole of the
great junction at Willesden, several of the loop lines and the railway workers'
houses there were his work. And, over forty years, he carried out many further
alterations and additions rendered necessary by the great increase in railway
traffic. He also carried out some 'heavy works' at Chalk Farm Station, and at
Euston; and the stations at Roade, Tring and Cheddington were his creations. In
Warwickshire he built Warwick Gaol, the gas-works at Leamington, railway
viaducts at Coventry, and the engine-sheds at Rugby. He also built the rectory
for the Rev Mr Pulteney at Ashley Canwell Hall, near Sutton Coldfield, and in
Northamptonshire he built Carlton Hall for Sir Geoffrey Palmer, Bart. Amongst
his industrial buildings were the coke ovens at Woodstone Wharf, Peterborough.
Another of his houses was one for Mr Newdegate, MP at Uxbridge.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080"><img height="183" src="lucydunkley.jpg" width="240" align="left">
 In all this Richard Dunkley the man himself remains elusive and one must assume
he was modest, though we have few other clues
as to his personality. Probate details confirm he left a multi-million pound
estate, when converted to present day valuations. He played little part in village or party politics.
His wife died before him, in 1871 (aged 65), and he was still living
in Blisworth at the time of the 1881 Census. However, he seems to have given up
the Loundes (which passed into the hands of Pickering Phipps, Jnr.) some time
before his death. He died in 1886 in his son-in-law's rectory in Alby, Norfolk,
because he had moved there to be with his daughter, being too old and
infirm to live alone. It is a little surprising that he is buried in Norfolk
rather than alongside his wife who died and is buried in Blisworth, though his death is recorded on her
tombstone which is particularly elaborate, see inset. No doubt there are reasons.</font></p>

        <p><font SIZE="3" color="#000080">The death is announced, in his
        eightieth-year, of Mr. Richard Dunkley, formerly a builder and railway
        contractor, well-known in connection with the earlier phases of what is
        now the London and North-Western Railway. He built for the London and
        Birmingham Railway Company, when the line was in course of construction,
        most of the workshops at Wolverton, including the turning and smiths'
        shops, the locomotive sheds, the saw mills, and carriage works; and he
        also carried out there many extensive alterations and additions, besides
        building many houses for the employees. He built the whole of the great
        junction at Willesden; constructed several of the loop lines, and
        erected 40 houses there for the company; and during a period of between
        30 and 40 years, he executed many important alterations and additions,
        rendered necessary by the great increase in the railway traffic. He also
        carried out some very heavy works at Chalk Farm Station, and at Euston
        Station; and Tring and Cheddington Railway Stations were erected by him.
        The railway line between Northampton and Market Harborough was
        constructed by him, including the tunnels through which the line passes.
        In the town of Northampton his works included the West Bridge at Castle
        Station, the Corn Exchange, the Midland Railway Station, the Post
        Office, the new Cattle Market with its roads, the breweries belonging to
        Messrs. Phipps and Co., Mr. Phillips and Mr. Manning, the Kettering Road
        reservoirs, and the roads and culverts on the Kingsley Park Estate. He
        also took down the old town hall, and carried out some additions to St.
        Andrew's Hospital, and the west wing, schools, and chapel of the Convent

 &nbsp;Next to Richard Dunkley's grave, shown here in a photo by Rob Brownlee, there are two
other graves; one is Frances Dunkley, his daughter; the other is Edwin Puckle,
who in addition to marrying another of Dunkley's daughters, Elizabeth, was
rector of Alby church. Further investigation into Edwin Puckle has revealed that
he had been a curate at Blisworth from 1859 to 1868, after which he had become
rector of Alby in 1868 until his death in 1909.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">The date of 1868 was recorded in Crockford's
Directory and ties in with fact that according to the inscription on Puckle's
gravestone he was rector at Alby for 40 years. There is a list in the vestry at
Alby which states that Puckle was rector from 1888 but this must be a mistake.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">Edwin Puckle married Elizabeth Dunkley (in
Blisworth Church) in early 1869, presumably having got engaged whilst still a
curate at Blisworth.&nbsp; Is it possible that upon his retirement, Richard
Dunkley left Blisworth, with his spinster daughter, Frances, to go and stay with
Elizabeth and Edwin, his daughter and son-in-law in Alby Rectory (now the Old
Rectory). This must have been after 1881 since the last date we have found for
Richard Dunkley in Blisworth is the 1881 census which records that he was living
in The Loundes.&nbsp; This then is the background behind Richard Dunkley being
buried at Alby, although there is still no answer to the question of why he was
not brought back to be buried with his wife in Blisworth.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">It is possible that the position of the grave
could be of some importance. Both the present rector of Alby and the occupants
of the Old Rectory remarked on the 'prominent' position of the graves, being in
between the Church and the Rectory. One can understand Edwin Puckle being buried
there since having been incumbant for forty years, he had trod that ground more
than anyone. But of all the graves, Richard Dunkley's holds the most prominence
despite having only been resident at Alby for, at the most, six years. I am
beginning to wonder whether Dunkley, who, following a productive and succesful
career had some wealth behind him, perhaps established some sort of financial
connection with Alby Church - see footnote.&nbsp;</font></p>

great grand daughter of Richard Dunkley loaned the daguerreotype photos for
copying and points out that Richard Dunkley paid
regular and substantial tithes to the church (Kelly's Directory, 1883) so perhaps
the grave location mystery is solved.</font></p>
