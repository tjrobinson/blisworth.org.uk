        James Payler</span></b><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">, always
        known as Jim or Jimmy, was born in 1940 in a cottage down from the Sun,
        Moon &amp; Stars, just by the canal. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>His father was a Canal Company worker, and Jim fished there as
        a boy - it was to become one of the loves of his life.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

        family moved up to 40 High Street next door to the Fosters who, a little
        later, sold to the Pykes who became good friends<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">.&nbsp;
        </span>Jim
        and Beryl met in 1967 - both were members of different Rambling clubs
        and they met on what Beryl describes as a pub-crawl! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>They
        were <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">married in 1968 and at that
        time Jim was working at the CWS Wholesale
        </span>Depot in Guildhall Road. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Jim
        moved on to be an Area Rep for the CWS. He worked for Express Lifts for
        a while before settling on the job which occupied most of his working
        life, which was spent installing and testing aerial masts, first and
        lastly for RTM (Radio Telegraph Masts), and in between for J Beam
        Aerials.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This was when police and ambulances needed the airwaves;
        Orange and the rest of the mobile phone stuff came later.&nbsp; The job
        took him all over the country, and Beryl remembers that even on <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">holiday
        in Scotland Jim felt the need to look out for aerials and ponder their
        function.&nbsp; On another occasion they travelled together to the
        Coventry area and searched for trees with pink rings marked on </span>them
        that indicated intended felling to form a clearing where a mast would
        go.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p></o:p>&nbsp;
        When discussing holiday locations, he would often reference a place to a
        particular not-straightforward aerial installation.

        </span>He was a Parish Councillor for 29 years, where he was always
        ready to make comments and suggestions in his characteristically cryptic
        and sometimes<br>
        fairly blunt way. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>His
        special interest there, of course, was Public Footpaths and to his great
        credit some footpaths are open now that certainly wouldn't be if he
        hadn't pursued this cause so strongly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">He organised Summer Walks,
        and many of us will remember, &quot;Come on, we </span>have got to keep
        the footpaths open&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
        jaunts often took us through the middle of a field and sometimes barbed
        wire had to be cut! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
        outings always<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt"> ended up at a pub.

        Blisworth Marina Open Day and one was accepted in the <i> Chronicle and

        hope that it will be. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Oddly,

        on, members of the Canal Partnership and helpers assembled the wooden seat
        in memory of Jim Payler and installed it next to the 18 mile canal marker. Later, a brass plaque was fixed to the seat. Construction was appropriately done using elm boards from the hull of an old wooden work boat with oak boards for the seat itself.
        The seat was created by Matt Onderka-Lang who is a forester and woodsman
        with a workshop in Welford.</font>
