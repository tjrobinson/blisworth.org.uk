      died in April 2011 his widow Beryl has been slowly but surely sorting out
      most of his canal scenes and boats photographs. There are thousands and
      fortunately Caroline Newbery came to the rescue and helped with
      cataloguing the pictures and the newspaper cuttings, scanning negatives
      and prints into a computer and putting a name to nearly all the shots. In
      June 2013 it was time to put on a show. Professional photographer Lisa
      Jeffries printed and mounted over 150 pictures to create the exhibition.
      The range of pictures covered a host of 'old names' for boat enthusiasts
      to recall and some groups of such scenes as tunnel repairs, canal
      dredging, repairing lock gates, boat paintings, ice breaking, the
      &quot;Jam 'ole Run&quot;, various pubs and scenes of canal life. The majority of the pictures
      are <a href="../../Payler&#32;Albums/jpayler.htm"> distributed on this
      website</a>, of course, but it was a great experience
      to see them professionally printed and mounted. The exhibition was seen by
      over 350 people, some travelling quite a distance, eg. Somerset and
      Wakefield. It had been said that the show was the best of its type, ever.</font></p>
