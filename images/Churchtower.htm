        <p align="center">All pictures are presented at relatively low resolution.&nbsp;
        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.
