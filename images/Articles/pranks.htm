        <p><font color="#000080">My family lived in Rock House, Stoke Road, in
        the 40s.&nbsp; That's the first Grafton-style cottage, on the right, going up the
        road.&nbsp; Whitty Whitlock lived two doors further up in an almost
        identical house.&nbsp; Our back gardens all ran back to a large garden
        owned by the Freestons in those days.&nbsp; Well, Mrs. Whitlock was
        always quite concerned that Whitty drank too much, which he did, and she did what she
        could to reign the drinking in.&nbsp; Whitty was cunning about this and
        gave me, only a school lad, some money and a bag and sent me down to the
        Sun, Moon and Stars to get four bottles of Guinness, hiding them in the
        bag.&nbsp; I had to go to the bottom of my garden, through to Freestons
        along the back and then reach through a hole in Whitty's shed at the bottom of his
        garden.&nbsp; I was to put the bottles through the hole and shove them
        under a large pile of sawdust banked against the back wall of the shed.&nbsp; Whitty could enjoy his
        work making coffins and doing other carpentry jobs as long as I could
        get bottles for him often enough.&nbsp; Once, when I asked whose coffin
        was this I was varnishing, he said it was for Mrs. Smith.&nbsp; I went
        home and told my Dad what I was up to but he was not impressed because Mrs. Smith was
        alive.&nbsp; Next day I mentioned this to Whitty and he said, &quot;you don't
        work very fast with that varnishing so she <i>will</i> be dead by the
        time it is done&quot; - I never asked a simple question again because Whitty
        was always pulling legs.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Over the years Whitty must have lost many buckets down his garden
        well.&nbsp; He could make anything out of a piece of wood and he fashioned a long piece of wood with an openable hook on
        the end.&nbsp; He gave me this tool and wound me down the well, aged seven, sat on a flat seat where
        a bucket would be.&nbsp; I could see under the water and I used the hook
        get the handles and rescue his buckets.&nbsp; I got more than just his
        buckets though; a total of fourteen.&nbsp; When I told my Dad that's what I had
        been doing he was furious with Whitty.</font></td>

        was imminent, they would collect buckets of water, and in the dark would
        pour it through the railings of the school yard, or down the path in the
        Courteenhall Road so they would have super slides in readiness for the
        pre-school hour the next morning ... I have since learned that a certain
        caretaker scattered ashes from the school stoke hole and spoiled the
