        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        started at Blisworth school, aged five, in September 1948.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I had had one term at school before we moved to the village so it
        was not so strange to me as to most of the other starters that day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One of the first children I remember meeting was Peter Newcombe
        (destined not surprisingly to be always top of the class in Art as I was
        always near the bottom in that subject).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also met that day Marjorie Dilworth from Tiffield and
        we kept in touch through the years until her death in 1996.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The new children included some from Gayton and Tiffield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        had to walk to school and back again (a good mile each way) but most
        children did so in those days, and we thought nothing of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I walked <a href="SMJ&#32;Cottages.htm"> part-way down Station Road</a> and then along the canal
        towpath to Candle Bridge, then up to the school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Sometimes I went the long way round – to the bottom of the road
        and up the hill to the elm tree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
        I went that way I often called for Margaret Digby who lived half way up
        the hill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        was in Miss Hare’s class for two years, then Miss Hickman’s, and
        then Miss Burt’s where I took the 11-plus exam. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
        clearly remember the day King George VI died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Headmaster, Mr. Cole, came in and whispered something to Miss
        Hickman and as soon as he left the room she stopped the lesson and spent
        the rest of the session telling us what it would mean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">One
        of my favourite lessons in the juniors was the last one on Thursday
        afternoon when Mr Cole would come in and read to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He always found good books.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I still occasionally reread one of the best – “Brendon
        Chase” by BB.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">We
        did a short mental arithmetic exercise most mornings – a very good
        idea and I still reap the benefits from it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Otherwise the lessons were mostly of the style where the children
        just sat and listened, we were not expected to participate in the way
        they are these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
        were expected simply to accept what we were told, and questioning
        anything was not encouraged.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">When
        I started school we used to mark Empire Day in May – we went out into
        the playground and one or two pupils read poems, and the Headmaster said
        something about the day’s significance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>After a year or two this stopped.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        playground was divided between “girls and infants” and “boys”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only partly tarmaced when I started, and the gravelled
        area was very painful if you fell over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In my first year the only toilets were earth closets at the far
        end of the playground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        arrival of flush toilets the next year seemed quite a luxury, but it was
        still a long walk up there!<o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">School
        dinners were provided but came in containers, having been prepared on
        another site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About half an
        hour before lunch some of the older boys had the job of setting up the
        trestle tables and putting out the cutlery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We had set places on the tables and went up to collect our
        dinners in a strict order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        meals seemed good – meat and vegetables and a hot pudding and custard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There was sufficient, but by modern standards the range and style
        of the meals was very limited, and there was a pretty predictable menu
        for each day of the week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        two ladies serving the meals were Mrs. Douglas and Mrs. Burton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For a short period one year we had to <a href="../schools-three.htm#dinners"> go to the Old School</a> for
        dinner but I cannot remember the reason for this.<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><font size="3"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">
        When we were in the Old School we were given one day potatoes cooked in
        their jackets, and this was the first time I had encountered them.&nbsp;
        I had no idea whether or not you were supposed to eat the jacket part,
        so I left it until I could see what other children were doing, by which
        time it was too late and our plates were taken away.&nbsp; A mistake I
        have never made since!</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">Infants
        and juniors were not allowed out of the school at dinnertime but the
        older pupils were allowed to go to the shops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This was before the Secondary Modern school was opened at Roade
        so Blisworth School had some pupils up to age 15.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Younger pupils had to ask an older one if you wanted some sweets
        or an ice-cream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        took the eleven-plus and went on to Towcester Grammar School in 1954.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I then caught the school bus (actually a normal service bus
        to Towcester) opposite the bottom of Station Road.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>From time to time I missed the bus – I’ll swear it went
        early! – and if lucky I got a lift.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In the first year or so a fairly regular lift on a Monday morning
        came from the wife of the local MP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>She had brought her husband to Blisworth Station to get the train
        to London, and picked me up on the way back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>She was a very pleasant lady and had a very comfortable car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Sometimes she had her daughter with her, then aged about seven or
        eight.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She was a quiet child but very observant, quietly watching
        and noting everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
        only a year or so the lifts stopped – I suppose the MP no longer
        caught the train.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I never
        heard of the child again until a few years ago when I opened my
        newspaper and saw her photograph.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eliza
        Manningham-Buller had been appointed head of MI5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>So I can say that I have been scrutinised by the Head of MI5!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
