BLISWORTH 1800 - 1930</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000080" size="4">Based on a piece penned by
George Freeston c. 1970</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is not often that Blisworth gets into the headlines
but <a href="village_house_famine.htm"> there was one occasion in April 1911</a>. There was a question in a
Parliamentary Session when a labour MP, Mr Fred Kellaway, verbally attacked the
Duke of Grafton (who was landlord for 90% of Blisworth at the time) for not
building enough new houses in the village. The question was vehemently replied to by his
kinsman Mr Fitzroy who was our MP (a Conservative one and a relative of the Duke
of Grafton, as it happened).&nbsp; To read the article that is linked above is
to understand the severity of a problem that evidently had been developing for
many years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The problem of Blisworth housing commenced with the
arrival of the Canal in c. 1800 and the businesses encouraged by that and the
fact that the Northampton road had been designated a turnpike. Then the arrival
of the LMS railway line nearby in 1838 with its station further placed demands
on housing. Then the Westley business of baking and milling increased demand
too. The problem was answered in the short-term each time. The railway company
built a terrace of twelve houses by the embankment which were to accommodate
over 70 people at times, including the lodgers. The Westley family built the row
of cottages on the hill - Pynus Cottages - for 6 families and the &quot;Westley
Buildings&quot; in the Stoke Road for another 27 families. Actually, these
latter were not necessarily occupied by mill workers and it seems they were
Blisworth's first speculative building project. The Duke built a few good
quality cottages in the villages in Victorian times - fifteen in all. These are
in elegant groups; two twins in the Stoke Road, a triple in the lower High
Street (The Gables),
a quad off the Courteenhall Road (Mt Pleasant) and other twins on the main roads
out of the village - Knock Lane and Courteenhall Road. These were built in the
1870 or '80s whilst five farm houses were built outside the village in 1820 - 1850 for
farmers 'best suited' to farming the new inclosed fields.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A wholly justifiable complaint about Grafton was that
there were surely insufficient <u>modest houses</u> for labourers especially
when ironstone mining, encouraged by the Duke, was building up from 1860 onwards
and many workers who had to walk daily from the neighbouring villages would have
preferred to move - instead they lodged. The Duke's tenants were expected to
carry out internal repairs while the Duke attended to the thatch - walls were
rarely pointed.&nbsp; However the Duke was not making a sufficient income to run
his Estate properly - some businesses were managed abysmally.&nbsp; Taking in
lodgers was the general form and there are numerous stories of a one up and one
down cottage accommodating seven people. One individual changed his lodging six
times before he was lucky enough to rent one for his family.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Around 1910, there was a radical element developing in
the village, being a labourer/working community, whilst the Parish Council
remained firmly Conservative. Then came WW I with its rapid readjustments in
social values. Quite possibly Blisworth might have been highly charged after
that war but the old Duke died and the Estate was forced a sale in 1919 because
of death duties. Typical cottage prices were £50, said to be equivalent to
£100000 today, and many were sold in groups to the prosperous families of the
village with the Duke's tenants continuing with the new owners. The group of
four cottages off the Courteenhall Road were probably bought by the Baptist family Westleys -
the name, Mt Pleasant, in recall of a Baptist Chapel in Northampton. It is said that the new
landlords provided the let for the duration of their lifetime and not
necessarily for their offspring, consequently some villagers were evicted to the
Towcester 'Work House' - being actually some council run community housing. The
poor and unfair conditions were gradually swept away, in actions that began in the 1930s, as
some of the worst houses in the village, including the Westley Buildings, were
demolished and replaced with many dozen council houses. These were initially set
up with outside
privies and outside wash-houses.&nbsp; They had bathroom and a bath but there
was no connected hot or cold
water. A piped water supply was not laid on to the village until 1954. For many
years, a majority of Blisworth families were simply poor. [Ed. The subsequent
development of the village reflected that point; though many would argue interminably
about that.]&nbsp; The local school
served the families well but all the merchant and farming families aimed to send
their children, or perhaps just their first born, to the fee-paying Courteenhall
School.</font></p>
