        <br>
        The traveller by the night mail starts from his uneasy nap as the cry of the railway porter runs along the lengthy train; and, peering out into the night, forms his idea of
        Blisworth as of a long enclosed platform, with a refreshment room at one end and bowery tea gardens on the
        other with, perhaps, twinkling lights in the shrubberies, and the lingering sounds of music,"
        and ladies' laughter coming through the shade."<br>
        <br>
 In the old coaching days, a town or a village and its name were associated together; now you may hear the name of a place duly announced hundreds of times, yet never get an inkling of the place itself. Your mail coach penetrated the very heart of a town; you were familiar with its Guildhall, its market-place, its church,
        and its chief inn, though you never left your seat on the box. The mail train only skirts the places at which it professes to stop; the town itself may be a mile or two off, and even where you touch upon it the chances are that you are introduced only to its most squalid suburb.    Great are the advantages of railways, but the advantage of seeing towns as yon travel is not one of them. Yon
        run by them, not through them, and to read as you run is out of the question.<br>
        <br>
        <b> Blisworth</b> is a good mile from the station. The walk thither by the canal side
        in the early morning is delightful, though the introduction of steam in the canal boats, and the repair of the towing path with cinders and clinkers, have not improved it. On the
        left the view is bounded by the railway embankment, covered with trees; on the right meadows slope to the water's
        edge (</font><font color="#0000FF">currently Colin Wakelin's fields - once ridge
        and furrow areas extending across to the Northampton Road</font><font color="#000080">); here and there a fringe of willows, reflected in the
        stream</font><font color="#0000FF"> (canal)</font><font color="#000080">, tempts the
        sketcher to linger. Southward the church tower, with the lofty elms
        about, peopled in the early spring with busy rooks, makes a picturesque distance. As you approach the Blisworth Bridge, a red-brick
        wharf (</font><font color="#0000FF">we are not aware of the detail of buildings at the
        wharf <u>before</u> Westley's mill was built in 1879 and commissioned by
        1883</font><font color="#000080">), toned with grey and yellow lichens, repeating in the water its rich and glowing tints,
        can be passed unheeded by nobody who appreciates colour. It is a remarkable instance of the way in which nature sets about correcting the
        un-picturesque works of man. Time, destroyer though he be, is a great artist, and converts the most unlovely forms into objects that arrest the passer-by, and compel his admiration.</font>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Blisworth itself looks like a place that has been more important than it now affects to be. It abounds in sixteenth and seventeenth century houses, substantially built of
        stone, with good Tudor windows, stone mullioned and square hooded. Mr. Gibbs's house
        (</font><font color="#0000FF">this is Manor farm house, <a href="../SpecOccasion01.htm#manor house">photographed
        incidentally</a> c 1890, demolished c1896
        and later replaced by the Burbidge family by a red-brick 'Manor House'
        which stands today</font><font color="#000080">) is a good specimen, and retains, though somewhat mutilated in the heading, the original
        doorway (</font><font color="#0000FF">the stone components of the fine
        Tudor doorway were kept in the yard by the Burbidge family for many years. A young George
        Freeston, b 1911, lamented the eventual destruction of the components</font><font color="#000080">). Some of the buildings present striking instances of the use of lines of dark coloured stone. Many houses, now occupied as cottages, were obviously built for tenants of a much higher class. One bears the date
        1616, another 1631. A stone in a building, more decidedly of the cottage character, near the
        blacksmith's (</font><font color="#0000FF">at the Cross</font><font color="#000080">), is
        inscribed NG 1G 1613. The dead wall in the centre of the village, on the southern side of the highway, has the appearance
        of having been at some time an extensive building; it bears traces of doors and windows, which have been walled up, and the stone work is very substantial and well finished. Bridges makes no allusion to
        it (</font><font color="#0000FF">however, we recognise this building as
        one which once filled the gap between our recent post office and the
        current Spar shop; in other words a building lost in <a href="../Greatfire.htm"> the great fire of
        1798</a> labelled 'b' in the first map presentation of the article on the
        fire</font><font color="#000080">). He speaks, indeed, of the Manor House near the church, and says, "The old seat which stood there was formerly the residence of the family of Wake. Here was antiently a park and a warren." The wall in question
        can scarcely be said to be near the church in the strict sense of the word, but " near" is a vague word, and part of the appurtenant buildings may have stood here.
        </font><font color="#0000FF">The 'dead wall' is explained - the old house that
        <u> was</u> actually the Seat of the Wakes is of course the now entitled
        &quot;Blisworth House&quot;, which is <i>very</i> near the church, as indicated to the researching clerk for <a href="../Bridges-history.htm#seat">
        Bridges by a curate in 1718</a>. The Park was the pleasant fields both sides
        of the canal on the south side of the main road and the warren was that
        field now occupied by the Stoke Road allotments.<br>
        </font><font color="#000080"><br>
 The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, stands towards the western end of the village; it consists of a western
        tower that is battlemented, a nave, north and south aisles, and chancel. Within the last few years it has been
        restored (</font><font color="#0000FF">1856 <a href="../Church-Images2.htm#Law"> by architect
        E. Law</a> for the
        first Mr. Barry as encumbent</font><font color="#000080">), and is in substantial condition. The old high, square pews, in which our forefathers loved modestly to screen themselves from the curiosity of their neighbours, and upon the possession of which it is certain that very much dignity was supposed to depend, have
        </font><font color="#0000FF">(in the 1856 'improvements') </font><font color="#000080">given way to uniform low seats; the tower arch, which used to be blocked up by a gallery, has been opened; and the pillars of the nave have been cleaned of their many coats of paint. The interior presents no remains of an antiquity greater than the Decorated Period, unless we are to accept the font, a perfectly plain bowl on a bowl reversed, as
        of Norman antiquity (</font><font color="#0000FF">no one has denied
        that!</font><font color="#000080">). The chancel is of ample dimensions, and has a handsome Perpendicular screen, and stalls and panelling of the same date. A small piscina remains in the south wall. Just without the chancel are the doorway and opening above to the Rood-loft. A stained window in the chancel represents the raising of Jairus' daughter, in memory of the son of the rector, the
        Rev. William Barry. In the south aisle is a canopy of rather peculiar form, over a founder's tomb, and nearly in front is a fine altar tomb, which Bridges thinks may have formerly stood beneath the arch. But they evidently belong to distinct periods, and we see no reason to suppose that the tomb has been removed from its original site. It is to the memory of Roger Wake; the sides are of the freestone of the
        neighbourhood </font><font color="#0000FF">(perhaps so)</font><font color="#000080">, the upper slab of marble, into which are let several brasses.    One of these represents a marble figure in complete armour with the hands in the attitude of prayer; another, a female figure in a similar attitude: beneath the former are three figures of children, and beneath the latter four similar figures. At each
        corner of the slab is a shield charged with the arms of Wake and Catesby, and similar shields connected with the Wake knot
        occur on the North front and West end of the monument. There appear to have been sculptures of a similar kind at the East end, but the work is too
        much defaced to be intelligible. Another brass of an ornamental form is missing from the
        centre of the upper part of the slab. A border of brass encloses the whole, part of
        which is missing, in part since Bridges' time. What remains is inscribed
        with Bridges, in copying the legend, has given only four C's, making an error of a hundred years, and antedating the period of Roger Wake's death 1403 instead of 1503. This Roger Wake was descended from Baldwin Lord Wake, who derived the manor and advowson of Blisworth from William de Briwere, who received them as a grant from King John. He was a man of mark. Having married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir William Catesby, of Ashby St. Ledgers, the favourite of Richard III., he espoused the cause of that monarch, with whose fortunes his own also
        succumbed. After the battle of Bosworth Field his lands became forfeited to the Crown, and in the third year of Henry VII. the manor
        of Blisworth was granted to Sir James Blounte. This attainder, however, was reversed in the same reign, and he was reinstated in his possessions, including Blisworth, where he founded a Free-school. His son, Thomas Wake, sold the manor to Sir Richard Knightley, of Fawsley, whose descendant, Sir Edmund Knightley, exchanged it for the manor of Badby and certain other of the dissolved Abbey Lands. It was then annexed to the Honour of Grafton, and his Grace the Duke of Grafton is its present possessor.<br>
        <br>
 In the tower hangs a wooden tablet, recording an exploit of some of the forefathers of the village, when Blisworth seems to have cultivated
        bell-ringing: - &quot;To the memory of the following ringers, John Gudgeon, Win. Peach, Benjamin Goode, Thomas Carter, and Thomas Garner, Who on ye 31st December, 1790, Did
        ring 45.6 scores in 3 hours and 40 minutes, which amounts to 5,000 changes. Written by B. Dunckly, clerk, May 12, 1791." Taking this inscription in its literal sense, one would be led to understand that those gentlemen all died of their exertions between December and May. We hope that was not so, and that the tablet was put up in memory of the exploit, not of the actors in it.
        </font><font color="#0000FF">(The burials were actually 1794, 1806,
        1813, 1821 and 1856!)</font><font color="#000080"> On the north side of the chancel there is a confessional window; and in the
        churchyard, which is ascended from the road by a flight of steps, are the steps of a cross now carrying a
        sun-dial (</font><font color="#0000FF">such is apparent in our <a href="../Loundes/photographs.htm#church"> oldest
        photograph of the church</a></font><font color="#000080">).<br>
        <br>
 Blisworth, irregular, straggling, and covering a considerable area, is a pleasant and picturesque village, picturesque and pleasant in its very irregularity. Gardens and trees intervene between the houses; huge elder trees, roses in masses, brilliant tiger lilies, profuse wall-flowers, delight the eye, and fill the air with odour. Blisworth seems to have a special enjoyment in flowers. On the Stoke Bruerne turn Mr. Westley makes the entrance to his steam mills perfectly dazzling
        with geraniums and petunias, and other brilliant plants (</font><font color="#0000FF">actually
        located a little way, on the left, along the Stoke Road - this mistake
        has led some to assume the mill was roughly where Crieff House is
        located</font><font color="#000080">). A noble row of elms borders the churchyard, and the rectory is fairly hidden in trees. Almost from any point in the village, an artist may make a picture. At the
        North -East turn there is the tree which was once the indispensable feature in the scenery of our ancestral villages
        (</font><font color="#0000FF">referring here to <a href="../Elmtree.htm"> the elm tree</a> at the Northampton
        corner</font><font color="#000080">):</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080"> "How often have I blest the coming day,<br>
 When toil remitting lent its turn to play,<br>
 And all the village train, from labour free,<br>
 Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree."</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Blisworth lies high, and a little
        distance North of this point you look down upon the railroad. Descending towards it, the arch which connects the embankment over the road has a noble
        appearance - noble in its severe simplicity and stately proportions. We have already noticed the pleasant effect of the plantations of firs which adorn the slopes of the embankment.
        </font><font color="#0000FF">(by 2013 the trees on the north banking
        were in a shabby state and on the south banking, facing the village,
        Network rail had cut down all the trees to &quot;maintain a stable
        slope&quot;).&nbsp;</font><font color="#000080"><br>
        <br>
 To write of Blisworth, and to say nothing about Blisworth Gardens, would be almost like playing Hamlet and leaving out the character of the Prince of Denmark. It is a pity that the
        access to them from the station is not easier, or rather that it is not more obvious, for it is really easy enough. The weary half-hour
        which one often has to spend oscillating up and down the platform would pass lightly enough if one might pass it instead, in wandering about those really charming grounds, brilliant with flowers, and refreshing with greenest turf and shady
        bowers (</font><font color="#0000FF">a peculiarity in the access from
        the station platform to the gardens gate is not apparent from any
        photographs or plans of the area</font><font color="#000080">). People are too apt, we
        suspect, to think of them only on those days when they are gay with groups of merry company, and to ignore the quiet charm of them at ordinary times, when they are comparatively deserted. But a pleasanter
        place to saunter in with a book at noon-day, or when you desire a "nest for evening weariness," you will not easily find. Among its other attractions, it has a lawn so beautifully embanked and so smooth shaven, that it seems impossible not to play at bowls there, or
        croquet, or archery, or any other of those good out-of-door games which ought to be
        encouraged for the sake of the ladies, and the health we desire them to possess.<br>
