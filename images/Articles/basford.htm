Basford (1886-1976)</b></font></p>
<p>Blisworth-born Arthur Eaton Basford died on June l8th 1976, aged 90 years;
His parents lived in one of the twelve Railway Cottages on the Northampton Road.
His father was a railwayman, as were all the other men-folk in the other eleven
houses in the row, which were built for railway workers by the London &amp;
Birmingham Railway Co. in 1848.</p>
<p>Arthur Basford commenced his schooling in the Infant School in the Stoke Road
(built 1874 -closed 1913) and then graduated to the <a href="../schools.htm">Senior
School</a> opposite (the building now awaiting restoration as a village hall).
The Basford parents were staunch Baptists, but the village school was church
controlled and of a foundation created in the year 1504. Clashes were inevitable
between some of the Baptist families and the Church over their doctrinal
teachings. Arthur's parents objected to the compulsory teaching of the
Catechism. They also objected to the local tax towards the education of the
village children which did not allow the Baptist community to have a say in
running the School.</p>
<p>In 1876 in the next village of Roade a National School was built for boys and
girls. This school was non-denominational, and this fact interested the
Blisworth Baptists very much. Subsequently, Arthur Basford and a small band of
other Baptist children went to Roade National School. They walked to and fro
daily taking with them their meagre meals for the day. Young Arthur was quick to
learn that this morning walk could be put to good account and for the sum of two
shillings and sixpence a week he delivered the then small amount of daily papers
to the villages of Courteenhall, Roade and Stoke Bruerne using both the morning
walk and the evening homeward trip to do so. Newspapers then were issued from
the bookstall situated on the platform of the main line at Blisworth Station.</p>
<p>On leaving school Arthur obtained work at Blisworth Station in accordance
with family tradition. By steady progression and subsequent promotions he duly
arrived at Willesdon Station. At Willesdon he met and married his wife where
they settled down and brought up their family of one daughter.&nbsp; On
retirement Arthur and his wife came &quot;home&quot; to Blisworth, and lived in
Connegar Leys, where they enjoyed a splendid &quot;evening&quot; of their lives.</p>
<p>Arthur Basford was a superb product (together with many of his
contemporaries) of a Christian family - a strict though kindly education based
on the primarys, i.e. reading, writing and arithmetic. He was further blessed
with a good brain by which he absorbed a great measure of the good things of
life through self education during his wonderful life of 90 years.</p>
