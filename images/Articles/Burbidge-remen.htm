<p><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>Some of Mr T Burbidge's memories recalled
for George Freeston c. 1970.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">[After enquiring what the radio was doing in George's
lap and learning that it was a tape recorder, &quot;it's a tape recorder, well I
never guessed!&quot;, he began to go through a book of prints of which, regrettably,
only a few have survived]</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;I was born in 1884 on the 1st June at 'The
Squirrel' Inn in Gayton and I was 2 years old when we came to Blisworth.&nbsp;
The Squirrel has now been renamed 'The Eykin Arms'.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Whilst showing a photo of the 16th century 'Old Manor House'
[<a href="Burbidge-remen.htm#manor">see note 1</a>] he said &quot; My father in 1893 bought this off the Duke of
Grafton, and the field behind, and in 1897 he took it down.&nbsp; The Duke came
round and said it should be put back up again.&nbsp; The Duke's agent, Paterson,
stored all the doors and timbers, the oak windows and the frames - Sturgess
would pay the price so the materials were stored, the wood doors etc. were
sold.&nbsp; Well the tarpaulin let the water in and all was spoiled.&nbsp; The
house we are sitting in [brick built - 'Manor House', 46 High Street] was built
over the old manor house and that was where Mrs Gibbs lived.&nbsp; The old manor
had a fine cellar and it had a stream running through it.&nbsp; There was a
brick trough through which the water ran day and night.&nbsp; My brother had it
filled in which was a pity - lovely clear water.&nbsp; There was a similar
stream in the baker's house.&nbsp; It reminds me the baker was a chorister and a
very good living man.&nbsp; Sometimes he had a day of booze (see <a href="../Lyrical/choir-suppers.htm"> choir
suppers</a>!)
and before that day he baked a double batch of loaves - one for the boozy day
and one for the day before.&nbsp; He used his cellar to store the loaves.&nbsp;
He knew when he was due for a booze up at the Royal Oak and he used to sing a
song there - and he used to sing:</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30"><font color="#000080"><i>So in all your transactions
let this be your plan.<br>
For the welfare of .... as well as you can.<br>
Do your duty, have mercy, be united together<br>
and .... through all like the birds of a feather!!</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">He would have another pint then, I suppose.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;These people [another photo] came from Kidlington
near Islip in 1899 they came to see this binder [<a href="Burbidge-remen.htm#bind">see note 2</a>] work in the top field next to
Longlands.&nbsp; They saw it working.&nbsp; A farmer came from Shutlanger and
said he would set fire to it at night if it was left in the field - he would
have done so too.&nbsp; We had eight binders at work at one time - before any
farmers had got them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;I know my father had the first grass mower in
Northamptonshire.&nbsp; And he had the first traction engine - a 1877 Allchin,
the first one made by them.&nbsp; And he had a Fowler - on three wheels.&nbsp;
You steered it from the front and then they were in the ditch before you knew
what to do.&nbsp; My father sent it back and they agreed to give him the order
for a new engine but that had to go back after the first threshing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;This is Ern - his milk round, <a href="../People.htm#ern">the
photo taken in
1894</a>&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">After a while, Mr Burbidge began to talk about his and
his son's timber business.&nbsp; The saw mill was located behind the site of the
old Manor House and is visible on some <a href="../aerialviews.htm#sawmill"> aerial
photographs</a>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;We cut trees down for the Master of Kinloss <a href="../Earlyindust.htm#stow"> at
Stow</a>.&nbsp; We cut £75000 - cut down wonderful trees.&nbsp; Queen Mary and
Princess Mary, when they came down they asked for the cedar to be cut
down.&nbsp; We took it down and sawed it up into coffin boards for the Jews -
they went to Dockham Bros., City Road - I think today it's Dottridge Bros.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;There were oak trees which went to the Midland
Railway - some for the carriages.&nbsp; The timber had to be 17 feet long,
twelve by five [inches], cut solid with no knots.&nbsp; There were ash trees
felled - went for aeroplanes to Howard Bros. - struts and bodies.&nbsp; The
sawing was done with a steam engine.&nbsp; All the men were on piece work for 12
years (at Stow) . . . .</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Much timber was sent to Weedon Wharf to go by
canal.&nbsp; Some sawn and some trees in the round.&nbsp; And we lowered the
trunks down by ropes into the boats.&nbsp; One boatman said he didn't want to
use ropes but just let them go on their own.&nbsp; I said it'll knock the bottom
out but he said &quot;Not my boats it won't!&quot;&nbsp; So we let a trunk go
and it went straight through the bottom of the boat.&nbsp; He cried like a
child.&nbsp; [laughter . .]&nbsp; It knocked the bottom right out.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;We used to supply the Mentmore Estate with 50
gates per year - very strong gates.&nbsp; The agent sent for me one day and I
went with the motor to Kettering, up the drive to the mansion.&nbsp; There was a
compressor standing across the drive and each side of the drive was kept like a
lawn.&nbsp; The forester, well at least I thought
he was, was spraying the Elm trees.&nbsp; So I got out of the motor and said do
you think the old Duke would mind if I ran on the grass?&nbsp; I don't think so,
came the reply.&nbsp; So then I said what do you think your doing.&nbsp;
&quot;Can't you see?&quot;&nbsp; So I said&nbsp; &quot;you're wasting the poor
old Duke's money, wasting spray and time&quot;.&nbsp; He said &quot;what do you
know about elm trees&quot;&nbsp; Well I said &quot;I think I know everything
about elms - you come along and listen to the bees - there must be a
million&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Yes&quot;, he said, &quot;of course I can hear
them&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Well elm disease comes with the plum white blossom and
there's no cure.&nbsp; They say starlings bring it from France and the bees
spread it from tree to tree&quot;&nbsp; Then he just said &quot;you're correct -
I'll be up at the office in a minute&quot;.&nbsp; When he came I realised then I had
been talking to the Duke, &quot;I do apologise your Grace&quot;&nbsp; He said
&quot;don't be sorry, you have told me more than any of the others - I have been
trying to find out what to do&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">What happened was we cut down all the diseased elms and
cut a million <a href="../Earlyindust.htm#coffin"> coffin boards</a> - there were
miles and miles of Elm avenue . . . </font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000080">--------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><a name="manor"></a>[1]&nbsp; The site of this Manor
House is shown clearly on the <a href="../1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_BridgeSt_1838.jpg"> 1838 Grafton Survey
map</a> - note it has plot 92 behind it.&nbsp; Ordnance Survey
maps of up to approx. 1970 show the area as the site of a Manor of some antiquity,
implying the Seat of the Wake family (13th to 15th century).&nbsp; A response
from <a href="../Bridges-history.htm"> the curate in 1718</a> to canvassed questions for Bridge's
county history indicate
however that the Seat was then thought to be in the grounds of 'Blisworth House'
ie. to the south-east of the church.&nbsp; This is not to deny the existence of
a significant 'Manor Farm' in the conventional relationship with the church - ie.
to its north but it <i>is</i> to suggest strongly that the Ordnance Survey team
in about 1830 had got it wrong. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><a name="bind"></a>[2]&nbsp; A binder is essentially a
grass mower able to cut corn crops which has been adapted to bind up with string
a quantity of <a href="../Farms.htm#binder">storks into a stook</a>.&nbsp; The
stooks are then set up to dry before being carted to a thresher.</font></p>
