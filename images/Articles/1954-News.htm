        Trades&quot; gives a helping hand at 83:</b>&nbsp; <i>Samuel Lack has
        been a Jack of Many Trades.&nbsp; He has worked in the local ironstone
        works, on the railway, on road repairs, on a farm, helped a salesman and
        worked in stables as a carrier.&nbsp; Today, at 83, although he retired
        many years ago, he likes&nbsp; to get out and do a little work. Besides
        the odd jobs he cultivates a fair sized garden and a 16 poles
        allotment.&nbsp; Mr. Lack remembers difficult times.&nbsp; When he first
        started work as a plough driver he earned only 3s. a week (15p) for a
        six day week, working from 6 am to 5.30 pm.&nbsp; &quot;There were no
        half-days or holidays in those days&quot;.&nbsp; When he was married he
        was earning only 21s. a week.&nbsp; There followed unemployment and the
        dole - and he was thankful to get a job as a road repairer.&nbsp; Mr.
        Lack comes from an old Blisworth family.&nbsp; He remembers years ago
        how his uncle used to '<a href="../Walks-Legging.htm">leg' barges</a> through the long, dark Blisworth
        Tunnel.</i><br>
        <b>&quot;The very heart's blood and soul of commerce&quot;</b>&nbsp; <i>That
        was the description given to canals at the beginning of the last century
        (~1800) and one of the major ones was built <a href="../canalpage.htm"> through the village</a> and was
        tunnelled through the nearby hill to reach Stoke Bruerne.&nbsp;
        Originally there were no ventilating shafts but two were added 12 years
        after its construction in the 3056 yard length of tunnel - following a
        hold up of barges which resulted in a child's death by
        suffocation.&nbsp; Before barges (now called narrow boats) were equipped
        with engines, Blisworth had 12 registered 'leggers'.&nbsp; These leggers
        lay on special outboards and by pushing their feet on the tunnel wall,
        propelled the boats forward.&nbsp; Payment for the journey was 1s. 6d.
        per man.&nbsp; They always had to walk back from Stoke Bruerne as the
        leggers of that village had the rights to the boats going north.&nbsp;
        Lock-keepers and other officials presented an imposing sight in those
        days.&nbsp; They wore high topped hats and gloves with glass shelters
        being set up to protect them from the weather!</i><br>
        <b>A hundred years the <a href="../whitlock.htm"> Whitlock family</a> have been the village carpenters
        and undertakers.</b>&nbsp; <i>Some of the entries in William Whitlock's
        huge account book make interesting reading (now 81, he retired 7 years
        ago).&nbsp; 'For making coffin for late W.A.Dunkley, aged two months,
        died Mar 2, 1899 .... 9s. 6d.&nbsp; For making coffin for late Joseph
        Carter, died June 26, 1896 .... £1 15s. 0d.'&nbsp; Mr. Whitlock said
        that the corresponding amounts today would be about £16 and and about
        £50.&nbsp; He joined his father at the age of 14 as soon as he had left
        school&nbsp; &quot;It was hard work in those days - right through the
        day from 6 am to 6 pm, no holidays&quot;.&nbsp; When his father died he
        took over the business and from then on until his retirement he has made
        many hundred coffins.&nbsp; He has also given service as the church
        sexton, retiring 12 months ago from that after 39 years.<br>
        Mr. Whitlock has vivid memories of the day the horse-drawn fire-engines
        came from Towcester and water was pumped by hand to put out a <a href="../Blisworth&#32;Mill/millers-fire.htm">fire in
        the old mill</a> that once stood on the site of the present of the <a href="../baconfactory.htm"> British
        Bacon Company</a>.&nbsp; He was only about five at the time and was carried
        to see the fire by his grandfather.&nbsp; Nowadays Mr. Whitlock spends
        much of his time in his garden or on his 12-poles allotment.&nbsp; And
        of course, he is always ready to do the odd carpentry job.<br>
        </i>The mill that caught fire was run by Joseph Westley.&nbsp; The loss
        prompted him to abandon the site for milling (though leaving a more or
        less undamaged bakery, eventually let to the Sturgess family, and build
        a <a href="../BlisworthMill.htm"> new mill in 1879</a> by the canal
        side.&nbsp; The new mill used a new
        technology based on roller milling, using china rollers, rather than
        flat limestone grinding milling.&nbsp; The next excerpt shows that
        Westleys retained some conventional grinders to cater for a continuing
        market for the traditional loaf - <u> this being the only reference to the
        mill accommodating a mix of milling techniques</u> at least in ~1900.<br>
        <b><a name="foster"></a>Mr. John H. Foster </b><i>was born in Greens Norton 75 years ago but
        has lived in Blisworth nearly 60 years.&nbsp; He began work in the mill
        at St. James' End in Northampton but when he was 20 he worked at the
        Blisworth mill.&nbsp; Here he was following in his father's footsteps
        when he became a mill stone dresser.&nbsp; The 17 cwt. stones needed
        attention every two or three weeks as they wore down.&nbsp; </i>[<i>This
        is the evidence that Westleys in 1899 operated old-fashioned milling
        alongside the modern - to cover the market demand for flours.</i>]<i>&nbsp;
        The cottage
        he lives in <a href="../High-Street/highst-detail.htm"> belonged formerly to a baker</a> and in the garden there is a
        large bake-house, empty of ovens now but full of old benches and tables
        which he lends out to villagers for fetes, etc. without wishing to
        charge anything but readily accepting the odd gift </i>[exactly as Jim
        Payler reports in his <a href="../Lyrical/1940memories.htm">memoir of
        1940s Blisowrth</a>].<br>
        <b>More examples of Blisworth workers.</b>&nbsp; <i>Working seven days a
        week from dawn to dusk for 1s. a week as a bird scarer was the first job
        for Mr. Fred Marriott, now 87.&nbsp; He should have been at school - he
        was only eight - but the farmer slipped the school-master 2d. and took
        Fred away with him.&nbsp; His next job was in an ironstone boat which
        carrier ironstone from one of the chutes, <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Ironstone-part1.htm">see
        image 18-08</a>, to the railway sidings nearby -
        this earned him 10s. a week.&nbsp; In those days (~1890) people came
        from all the surrounding villages to work at Blisworth and Mr. Marriott
        well remembers men walking in from Shutlanger and Stoke.&nbsp; They used
        to bring with them good &quot;clangers&quot; (bacon and onion
        dumplings).&nbsp; He also remembers that Blisworth used to have band </i>(<a href="../SpecOccasion01.htm">some
        carrying instruments in this photo, 23-01</a>)<i> and his father was band-master.<br>
        </i><b>Transport Issues: The Canal and the Railway Missed the Town</b>&nbsp;
        Once opened in 1805 the canal passed by Northampton at a distance of
        about four miles.&nbsp; At what we now know as Blisworth Arm, in the
        Parish of Blisworth, there was a short canal spur of length about 200
        yards and from it - <i>a <a href="../Canal/horse_rail_wharf.htm"> tramway once ran into
        Northampton</a>.&nbsp; It was
        apparently of rough construction and was powered by horse with the
        wagons probably running on flat plates.</i>&nbsp; In a ~1820 map the
        place is marked up as Northampton Arm, being a perfectly logical name
        that should have been retained as some have hijacked the place in the
        name of 'Gayton Arm'.&nbsp; <i>This form of travel between the canal and
        the town was not approved by the Borough of Northampton - they wanted a
        canal connection which would transport 'water-carriages'.&nbsp; In fact
        Willaim Pitt visited the county in 1806 and records the horse railway
        and remarks, from his recall of reports earlier, 1797, that a canal had
        been projected by the constructors.</i>&nbsp; By 1815 the flight of
        locks and the canal connection had been made.&nbsp; The horse railway would have
        immediately fallen into disuse.<br>
        The newspaper mentions the horse railway as background to the fact that
        a good railway connection was established by 1845, being the branch line
        from a new Blisworth Station to Northampton and on to
        Peterborough.&nbsp; In fact the main line missed the town when completed
        in 1838 and offered a simple station on the embankment near to the
        archway over the Northampton Road.&nbsp; There was <a href="../Railways/Npton-vind.htm"> much lobbying and
        argument </a> around that time but suffice to say a new station was quickly
        built, a little way towards the west, along with a fine Hotel.&nbsp; On the Northampton Road were built
        Grafton Villas to advertise local stone and nearby was established a
        toll house for as long as the road was a registered turnpike.<br>
        <i>Conditions at Blisworth Station 40 years ago are recalled by Foreman
        Walter Barden, who started work there in 1913 as a junior porter.&nbsp;
        In those days hundreds of people used the station every day, he says,
        and the staff were rushed off their feet.&nbsp; To connect with
        Northampton two coaches used to be slipped from the London
        express.&nbsp; The local gentry used to travel to Northampton by rail
        rather than car and that kept the trains full.&nbsp; There were freight
        wagons too, horse boxes and ironstone wagons - the sidings were quite
        extensive.<br>
        <a href="../People-two.htm#barden">
        Mr. Barden</a> is one of a remarkable railway family.&nbsp; His grandfather
        worked at Fenny Stratford for many years, his father was a shunter and
        foreman at Blisworth for 50 years and various others were platelayers or
        a blacksmith's striker.&nbsp; His father has recollection of a robbery
        while at Blisworth.&nbsp; About twelve years ago, one night he saw
        several people leaving the station, complete strangers - a car was
        waiting to take them away.&nbsp; Together with a booking clerk he had to
        go to Scotland Yard to go through hundreds of photographs but failed to
        identify anyone.<br>
        Mr. William Williams, a member of another railway family, reported
        recalling that the ground opposite the station was once thought suitable
        for a racetrack.&nbsp; How the history of the village would have changed
        if that plan had materialised.</i>&nbsp; In fact, the large plot of land
        has in more recent years has been 'offered' as a lorry park plus filling
        station on the new road and railway freight terminal with an exotic link
        to Northampton.<a name="aviation"></a><br>

        More Transport Issues: Early Aviation and the Village Garage</b>.&nbsp;
        On aviation, this is an excerpt from the editorial of the Northampton
        Independent, April 30, 1910.&nbsp; <i>The chief topic of the week has
        been, of course, the sudden appearance of competing aviators in the
        proximity of Northampton. Although everyone knew that Mr. Grahame White
        proposed to fly from London to Manchester last Saturday, yet, truth to
        say, very few people expected him to reach Rugby. When, however, the
        news spread through the town that while we were peacefully slumbering in
        bed the aviator had flown through the county, we could hardly believe
        our ears; and before our surprise was over, Mr. White had started on a
        second attempt almost simultaneously with M. Paulhan and had landed for
        the night at Roade. Yesterday morning we knew that the great feat had
        been accomplished, and that Paulhan had won the £10,000 prize. The
        local commotion caused by the flights was enormous, and, as a result,
        there has been a sudden awakening to the vast possibilities of the
        aeroplane. While successful flights were being made in France and
        America, only a mild interest was evinced locally, and even when
        Blackpool and Doncaster held aviation meetings, last Autumn, and the
        Channel was crossed by Bleriot, our attention was but transient. The
        establishment of an aerodrome at Huntingdon began to bring the subject
        of flying nearer home to us, then, quite unexpectedly, within a week,
        daring aviators have traversed the Midlands and almost passed over
        Northampton itself. After this we shall look upon the aeroplane as an
        accomplished fact, as something that has emerged from the experimental
        stage into the realms of the practical; and a few years hence flying
        will probable be as much an everyday occurrence as is motoring.</i><br>
        <img height="398" src="over-blisworth.jpg" width="270" align="left">
        An article in the body of the issue includes this delightful passage - <i>What
        will happen when we can all take trips in the air one can only
        conjecture. Certainly we shall all live the higher life and Socialists
        and others with Utopian ideas, whose heads are already in the clouds
        will be in their element. Politicians and poets who now indulge in wild
        flights of fancy will be more irrepressible than ever, and everything
        will be treated in an airy spirit. We shall require doors in the roofs
        of houses, and governments will be able to turn deserts to profitable
        account by letting them out as advertising spaces. The whole aspect of
        civilisation will be changed.</i><br>
        This is our cue to note that the Graham White flight passed over
        Blisworth as the inset photograph from 'the independent' seems to
        indicate.&nbsp; A Sarah Barden of Blisworth, mother of the Walter Barden
        mentioned above, is recalled as saying as the plane flew over &quot;man
        is getting too clever for himself&quot;.&nbsp; So 1910 is the first
        recording of airplane flights over Blisworth.&nbsp; We might conjecture
        that certain hot air balloon flights may have flown over Blisworth
        before then, taking off from <a href="../Blisgardens.htm">Blisworth
        Gardens</a>.&nbsp; The next occasion was when the school children
        experienced interesting times in 1913 with the beginning of the RAF
        flying over the county - <a href="Great_war.htm">see School Records</a>.</font><p style="padding-left: 5; padding-right: 10; padding-bottom: 30"><font color="#000080"><b>The
        year 1910 was also the year the Freeston family</b> came to the village
        and one year later Eliza, the mother (still alive at 82 in 1954), gave
        birth to her fifth son George.&nbsp; It was George who developed into
        the zealous collector and amateur village historian and so into the
        chief source, indirectly, of a majority of the information on this
        website.&nbsp; The newspaper we began with on this page has something to
        say about the brothers:&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>If you want your car, cycle or
        radio mended, if you need a taxi or if you just want to know something
        about the village, the people to see in Blisworth are the Freeston
        brothers.&nbsp; Four of them, Ronald, William, George and Frank run the
        garage whilst Ralph works in the railway offices.&nbsp; Their business
        has progressed through the years beginning with carpentry and wheel
        wrighting, being the trade of both father and grandfather elsewhere in
        the County, and later incorporating petrol sales and repair work - all
        at <a href="../aerialviews.htm">the garage on the corner </a>of Stoke
        Road and the High Street.</i>&nbsp; George ran a taxi service and Ron,
        from his naval experience, repaired radios (and worked as a
        decorator).&nbsp; Some anecdotes are provided in the <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#freeston">locally
