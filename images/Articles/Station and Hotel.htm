        Railway Station and Station Hotel in the early fifties</font></b></span></font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        grew up with railways and using the station was routine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>That was how we got to Northampton or occasionally further.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>My father went to work by rail; we had no car in those days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We were able to use Privilege Tickets (PTs) which let us travel
        at a reduced fare, and my father was allowed up to 6 free passes a year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>These were used for our August holiday journey and other
        occasional trips to see relatives in Nottingham.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        station was busy then, with LMS main line traffic as well as local.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But it was the SMJ line I remember best – it ran along the
        bottom of our garden with its own signal box near the houses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I remember often “chatting” to the signalman when I was
        small, and watching the men using the turntable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Ironically, I never travelled on the SMJ.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        had, very sensibly, been brainwashed as a child never to walk on the
        railway line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such was the
        intense quality of the warnings that to this day I cannot walk
        comfortably along even a disused line, I have to walk to the side and I
        keep looking over my shoulder to see if a train is coming!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And I hate going over modern level crossings with no gates – I
        am convinced they cannot be safe.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        noise from the line was never really noticed – you just did not hear
        it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        remember in the early years my father (in his job as a passenger
        representative for BR) organised special trains and buses to get motor
        racing fans to Silverstone for the Grand Prix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In those days most fans had no car of their own and used public
        transport.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The trains came to Blisworth station and a fleet of
        double-decker buses took the passengers on the rest of the journey.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the evening the buses came back to the station and they
        caught the specials back home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
        an hour or so at either end of the day the forecourt was very busy with
        buses arriving and departing every few minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I was allowed to watch this happening but only with a stern
        warning to keep out of the way of the vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>My father was told that without his arrangements to get so many
        fans there the (then new) racetrack would probably not have survived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>So please say thank you to my father next time you watch the
        Silverstone Grand Prix!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        Blisworth Hotel was owned then by John Henry Eaton-Hall and served also
        as the local pub for our end of the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Eaton-Halls had two young children, Frances and Johnnie. At
        different times there had au-pairs to help, then an unusual and rather
        exotic idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also living in
        a wooden bungalow at the back was Sir Francis (I forget his surname), an
        older chap who had helped the E-Hs to buy the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They always had several horses in the stables (a great attraction
        for my older sister) and were also, I think, responsible for the Lido.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They once had a miniature horse for a few months, and had an
        older mare, Daisy, in the field at the top of Ford Lane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I spent many happy hours feeding her grass and occasional
        carrots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I remember two
        beautiful grey hunters - Grey Moon and Blue Moon – but the stables
        were always full. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
        remember the hotel once had a few members of the D'Oyly-Carte opera
        company staying, and I can recall hearing them rehearsing songs. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        gardens at the back of the hotel were by that time a bit run down, but I
        remember being told that they had been very well kept in earlier days.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">My
        older brother John met his wife (Joan Chambers from Pynus Cottages -
        Pynus from &quot;Pyesnest&quot; field name) at a
        dance at the Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dances
        were held fairly regularly and were well-attended, but they had ceased
        by the time I grew up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        Hotel, in its guise as the local pub, had its regulars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Dick Hicks from 2, Ford lane was one, together with a few other
        bachelors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father, for
        several years, prepared the accounts for the Eaton-Halls, but otherwise
        drank there only rarely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        was taken in there once when I was eighteen and I drank half a pint of
        Phipps beer for the princely sum of 8d (3.5p).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>

        One
        of the fairly regular guests at the Hotel was Giles, the cartoonist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I think he was a friend of the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He stayed when he came for the racing and my father met him
        there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion the
        Silverstone Grand Prix was due to coincide with a meeting of Towcester
        races, and my father unwittingly gave Giles the subject of his cartoon
        by casually joking to him about the need for the meetings not to get
        confused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sure enough a
        cartoon based on this appeared in the Sunday paper. <o:p>
        </o:p>Evidently the Giles website has no record of this particular
        cartoon.&nbsp; [The inset photo is from Ebay as a Hotel Register was for
        sale recently].

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        Eaton-Halls started what later became the permanent caravan site.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For a couple of winter seasons in the early fifties they let
        the area to a circus to over-winter various animals.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I remember monkeys and horses and several rather
        exotic-looking people being there with their caravans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>After that there were a few “ordinary” vans, and later it
        developed into a large permanent site. At first this was not popular
        with the locals who, sadly, just rather presumed that people living this
        way must be a bit dodgy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        do not remember any such people.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">There
        was a field at the back of the caravan site, and at the far end was a
        rather neglected orchard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        do not know whether it had originally belonged to the Hotel or to The
        Loundes (their gardens backed on to the same spot).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Whilst a bit small the apples were still good to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Behind the orchard in what looked like a piece of overgrown
        wasteland could still be seen the outlines of the layout of an old
        formal garden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Again I do
        not know which property had been the owner but it was nearer to <a href="../loundes.htm"> the
        Loundes</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would love to
        know if any of this still exists or whether it has been swept away.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">In
        the next field along, in a rather boggy dip in the middle, snakeshead
        fritillaries grew each spring, until the farmer decided to drain the
        land and destroyed the patch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
        was no protection for wild flowers in those days!<o:p>
