<p style="padding-top: 0">Two stories from Fred Burbidge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></b><font SIZE="3">Fred Burbidge was
born in 1884 two years before being brought to Blisworth from Gayton.&nbsp; He, along
with his brothers, set up in the village a timber felling and sawing business
and a carpenters shop on an industrial scale on a site off the High Street,
opposite the church.&nbsp; His father had a steam-engine business which commissioned
traction engines, operated threshing machines and built special purpose
engineering equipment.</p>
<p>The first story was of Henry Ploughman as told to him by the Mallard
brothers, Freddie and Frank.&nbsp; In 1804 Henry worked on the tunnelling for the
canal.&nbsp; Having too much to drink the night before, he felt sick one Friday and
left the work place to walk home down the toll road (Stoke Road).&nbsp; He met the
horse and wagon coming up the road with the pay-day cash and flagged it down to
not miss out on being paid.&nbsp; He and the driver passed the time of day and, when
finished, he bid the driver farewell and went home to lie down.&nbsp; When the wagon
got to the tunnellers, the driver realised that the tailboard was hanging loose.
What was worse was that a bag containing half-sovereigns and some silver was
missing. The driver, seeing trouble brewing among the men, mentioned he had met
Henry on the way up and that he was not well.&nbsp; So a party of workers wasted no time in going down to
his house to see if Henry had found the bag lying in the road.&nbsp; Henry invited the men to search his
house, telling them he knew
nothing of the bag.&nbsp; However, a few
months afterwards, Henry left the village, to be never seen again.&nbsp; He did the
right thing by the villagers though; he cleared all his debts in the village
shops - in some cases paying them off with half-sovereigns.&nbsp; Perhaps the Grand
Junction Canal Company later got him a free passage to Australia!</p>
<p>The second relates to when Fred's brother Earnest travelled to Barnsley to
pick up and drive home a Fowler Road Loco steam traction engine, the one with
compound spring mountings for a smooth ride.&nbsp; While rumbling through Sheffield,
taking advantage of the springs, he was stopped and fined for doing 4 mph where,
over cobbles, he should have been doing only 2 mph.&nbsp; With what seems to be
reverse psychology, the police provided a placard to hang on the front of the
boiler which stated he may do 15 mph - so that he could depart Barnsley and
complete the homeward journey quickly.&nbsp; At that speed something was bound to go
wrong.&nbsp; He broke a spoke and veered into the side of a bridge, destroying 30 feet
of iron railings but managed to stay on the road.</p>
<p><b>And one from a village veteran: </b>Around about 1930, a group of 8 lads
walked for fun up the centre of a frozen canal from the mill to the ironstone bridge.&nbsp;
They
realised that as they got nearer to the bridge the ice was getting thinner.&nbsp;
With
the object of proving their bravery very much in their minds, they dared each
other to keep edging forward until one fell in and had to be hauled out onto the
field side. Luckily he was the one with a coat many sizes too big for him and
the extra trapped air under the coat probably saved his life.&nbsp; There followed a
cold trudge home, up the bank, round by the Stoneworks and across the allotments
field, heading for the railway cottages.&nbsp; By that time the coat was swinging off the lads shoulders - frozen
solid!</p>
<p>In those days they must have been as tough as the ice was thick!</p>
