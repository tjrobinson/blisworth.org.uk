        (1929) and Hooke (1985)</a> have discussed in detail the Droitwich salt
        production. Brine at a concentration 20 times that of sea water bubbles
        up from the ground in at least three places in or near Droitwich. The
        resulting salt, after boiling off&nbsp; the water is much purer than
        sea-salt and much cheaper (in fuel) to make. The use of salt as a
        condiment to enhance flavour was a luxury but its value in preserving
        meat and vegetables was vital for a community to live comfortably the
        whole year around. The salt production required labour, of course, and
        equipment made of both clay (available locally) and lead which had to be
        imported to fabricate evaporating pans. The main consumable was wood or
        charcoal and both were burnt at Droitwich. Manors not too distant from
        Droitwich habitually delivered wood by the cartload to pay for salt and
        this seems to have been organised along trackways now termed saltways -
        in the Anglo-Saxon era they were called &quot;saelt straets&quot;. Some
        say that the term &quot;straet&quot; denotes a 'made-up' trackway with
        compressed stone much similar to the metalling practiced by the Romans.
        Droitwich must have been an affluent area - the pre-Roman equivalent of
        Lichtenstein or Monaco (whose economies depend on a peculiar single activity
        found in a particular location - ie. bespoke banking and gambling
        respectively). <a href="droitwich.htm#refs">Houghton</a> estimates Droitwich salt
        production at ~1000 tons pa in 1086; most of it sent to Manors or Vills
        occasionally as far away as a particular Royal household in Princes
        Risborough. According to Anglo-Saxon charter texts the payment rate
        was often one cartload of wood (1.0 to 1.5 tons ?) for one mitt (L. mittas) of
        salt. A mitt is thought to be around 2 Cwt though very few historians have
        committed themselves. The L. <i>Mitta</i> presumable is related to L. <i>mittere</i>
        (ie. to send) and therefore could mean anything and apparently is a term
        applied only to payments for salt - perhaps meant at the time &quot;that
        which is <u>sent</u> (back, regularly) as a consignment&quot;. (see <a href="droitwich.htm#refs"> reference
        footnote</a>).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Saltway
        routes radiating from Droitwich run south, west, north-east and east.
        The south route parallels the use of the River Salwarpe, a tributary of
        the Severn, which would have either carried the product to Worcester or onto
        sea-going vessels capable of reaching the mainland coast of Europe. Such an export
        route is thought to be active in iron-age times and throughout the Roman
        period. The west route probably saw the trading for lead while the
        north-east route served the northern most parts of the Dubonni region
        (later the Hwicce region in Anglo-Saxon times). Interestingly it is
        thought by some that the north-east route was extended to the
        Lincolnshire coast at Saltfleet because of the frequent salt-related
        place-names found along that line (see the internet about Saltfleet). My
        theory is that such an extended
        route was not developed until Norman times when regional animosities
        were quelled. The sea-salt industry
        based at Saltfleet, which presumably derived some of its income revenue
        by export, would have wished to promote their status with a higher
        quality product. A similar argument might be voiced for the eastern
        route as some have realised that the compass heading for the route
        (seemingly east 7 or 8 degrees south) points to Harwich in Essex and the
        salt marshes just to the west of Harwich. To date, the idea of a long
        range route on this line enjoys just one reference - via the Ramblers
        Association c. 1978 as mentioned in the <a href="Roman-Salt-Way.html">2004
        article on the saltway</a> posted on this website, which this account supercedes. I have plotted the easterly route
        as far as the Salcey Forest in Northamptonshire. An imagination stretch
        would see it traverse by the market square in Olney (Buckinghamshire) but no
        suggestive lanes etc. on early OS maps seem to imply much of an extension beyond
        Olney. Houghton and Hooke researched the Anglo-Saxon and Norman charters
        (also the Domesday accountancy) and have been able to pinpoint saltway
        routes for most of their run. I have not done that yet, for Stoke
        Goldington, Ravenstone or Olney, but my work so far on the eastern
        projection is to be <a href="saltway-east.htm"> found on this website</a>.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>Trackway
        from Droitwich</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Roman road via Alcester to Stratford
        (Straet Ford) and onwards to Wellsbourne (Weles burne) is clear enough
        on both early and current OS maps. The route is littered with salt
        related place-names. Further east the next clue is Wormleighton. In the 956AD charter for Wormleighton
        the north boundary of the parish is described as the &quot;boare saelt
        straet&quot; and its line through to Priors Marston is clear enough.
        This village also lies on a stock drovers route and so has place-names
        such as Little London and &quot;The Butcher's Arms&quot; to substantiate
        that. It also lies at the boundary of the Hwicce kingdom with parts of
        Mercia. The next few miles are speculative with Preston Capes and Little
        Preston on the line. Northamptonshire amateur archeologists have
        discovered a couple of market meeting fields adjacent (on the south side)
        to the saltway running through Preston Capes. Somewhere in the
        vicinity of Preston Capes it is thought that a trackway also branches
        somewhat towards the north-east in order to serve Northampton. Then
        comes the alignment with Litchborough (a Lord of which imposed a toll on
        salt traders) and a remarkably linear alignment with footpaths through
        Grimscote and Cold Higham vectoring for Astcote on the opposite side of
        the Watling Street. As the line merges with the Gayton to Eastcote lane
        it acquires the name &quot;Salt Lane&quot; in some 1775 estate maps. The
        linear alignment continues right across Blisworth parish and includes
        part of the Knock Lane. The Litchborough to Knock Lane section is
        repeated here based on 1880 OS mapping - an improvement on the map
        employed elsewhere. The name 'Knock' is a placename for &quot;near oak
        trees&quot; ('at the oak' in OE was <i>atten oke </i>and the 'n' was
        subsequently joined to the next syllable to form noke, nock or knock).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">This

        Just click on the map to enlarge it.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">An
        interesting feature of the linear alignment is that it maintains a
        straight crossing over the Watling Street just
        south of Fosters Booth. This is reasonable based on the layout of 1885
        footpaths (the dotted line crossing) but pseudo-Lidar data indicate a
        slightly cranked line (discussed below). In the vicinity of Grimscote there is much
        evidence of possible east-west path-braiding but few instances of intersections
        with north-south running paths - all quite unusual. The saltway also copies the vector alignment,
        depicted on the map as a light-shaded broad line,&nbsp; of 'east 7or 8 deg. south' similar to the radiation out of Droitwich. What should we
        deduce from these facts? That the saltway preceded the Watling Street?
        That the target for the saltway was identified at Droitwich and that it was
        essentially the Salcey Forest or some feature beyond? Perhaps we do not
        realise that the area west and north of the Salcey Forest may be rich in
        high status Roman Villas. For example the villas that we know (or
        suspect) were located at (1) Piddington, (2)
        Gayton Hill on the Blisworth-Gayton parish boundary, (3) embedded in
        Nunn Wood, (4) on the verge of the saltway quarry (near the present day
        Glebe Farm) and (5)&nbsp; at the Folly (?) west of Tiffield. Such an abundance
        of Roman customers for Droitwich salt may have resulted in the
        romanisation or extension of the saltway into the area and also resulted
        in its
        straightening over the Watling Street. Neat field subdivisions drawn out
        at the time of 'enclosure' tend to cloud the issue. The height above sea-level
        and the photogrammetric data from www.bluesky.com have been studied and the
        slightly cranked Watling Street crossing, as drawn in the map, is confirmed the most
        likely, running just south of a slight elevation in the road. This is on the
        interpretation of slight hollows in the fields (assumed formed by
        tramping) and even a slight
        hollow in the road; 2 ft over a distance of 400 yards along the road.
        The evidence is <a href="wat-crossing.htm">posted
        here</a> for perusal.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Roman villas are marked in
        the map. Though it may seem incredible, the Northamptonshire customers
        could have paid for the salt with cartloads of wood or charcoal from the
        wooded parts of Blisworth parish or from the extended Salcey Forest
        (before, of course, it was so named). This view is reasonable if <i>straet</i>
        really meant a mad-up road that could take wheeled traffic.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A current view of the -<i>worth</i>
        ending to our village name denotes not just a place or an enclosure of
        houses but essentially one that was <u> marginally</u> located adjacent to
        waste or wooded grounds. Charcoal burning centres have been discovered
        north of Nunn wood, not far from Glebe farm. The saltway could well have
        served also for the long range transport of limestone but it is very
        unlikely that stone from Northamptonshire would be favoured since the western
        slopes of the Cotswolds are much more accessible to Droitwich (this is
        not to say that the salt Mansio would refuse payment in stone).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In
        the parish of Blisworth a field was named &quot;Saltway Furlong&quot;
        (1727) but it does not border the saltway. Perhaps a different prominent
        field hedge was mistakenly taken as the saltway route by farmers c 16C.
        This is a tease because it points to a time when the saltway was no
        longer in use - was that really 16C? A curate in 1718 referred to a white-stone quarry by the saltway. I think he was referring
        to &quot;a&quot; but the tiny quarry at &quot;b&quot; (in the 19C),
        actually alongside Saltway Furlong, could
        perhaps have been bigger then - see <a href="westsaltway.jpg"> the map</a>.</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Mitta: </b>The rate of
        exchange 2 Cwt of salt (ie. 1 mitt) being bought for a load of wood
        occurs similarly among various charters, apparently. perhaps a mitt is
        not a measure but merely <u>a sent amount</u> that reflected the
        assessed value of that particular load in terms of not only weight but
        also of its wetness and state of seasoning. Anyway, if the equivalence of 2
        Cwt of salt for 1 ton of wood is about right in terms of the sale deal
        then the Droitwich
        salt masters would probably not use it all on account of its
        thermal yield in order to dry to a mush the brine.<br>
        </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <font color="#000080">Given a
        modern 70% efficient wood-burner, processing 2 Cwt salt would require ~2
        Cwt of dry wood.&nbsp; Hurst however determined from some actual
        accounts that 4 Cwt of wood was required in the 14C - a remarkable
        efficiency.&nbsp; Consequently, even ~42AD, they should have a good deal
        of wood left over and could cover overheads and ancillary activities as
        well as probably support neighbouring heating needs - though no one has pointed this
        out. For those some distance from Droitwich a preferred deal would be to
        pay with money as cartage would have been problematical. Another consideration is the apparent rarity value of salt: for any
        family reasonably near to Droitwich, they need only to labour for perhaps a
        week to collect 1 ton and take perhaps another week's time and food (for
        oxen too) in delivery to receive enough salt to cure more meat and/or
        fish than they
        are likely to come across in a year! Therefore one should ask
        &quot;would not Droitwich be guilty of
        selling too cheaply?&quot;. Perhaps the rate that is suggested only applies to
        those Manors of Status that have bought or been gifted beforehand some
        rights to the
        salt - ie. the rate may have been to cover only the consumables and not much more,
        especially if
        the wood were wet and green.</font>
