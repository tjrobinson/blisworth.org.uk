<title>Roman Saltway, East from Blisworth</title>
</head>

<p><font size="5" color="#000080">Proposed Routes for the Roman Saltway East from
Blisworth Parish</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">From the 1729 Grafton maps it has been
possible to connect the Saltway at Pattishall Rd. with Knock Lane. (<a href="Roman-Salt-Way.html">See
article</a>).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">It would be satisfactory to have a <u>suggestion</u>
for its route to the east.&nbsp; In the Northamptonshire Records Office 18th
century<br>
maps of Courteenhall, Quinton, Roade and Hartwell Parishes have been examined.&nbsp;
Various paths rather suggestively line up<br>
- see the Google-based chart below (and use the horizontal scroll bar to work towards the
east).<br>
In the chart, <b>BW</b> means bridleway, <b>FP</b> footpath, <b>OPB</b> old
parish boundary and showing a path in 18C (may still be in the<br>
same position nowadays), <b>DisR</b> stands for dismantled railway.&nbsp; The
young farmer at Ashwood Fm seemed to know what I was<br>
on about but failed (!) to show me the line of trees which, along with the
crop-mark* in his field, seemed to clinch how the path<br>
heads towards Salcey Forest.&nbsp; The broad but overgrown path leading through
the forest was found first on foot by using one<br>
of the clearly visible access paths.&nbsp; Eye of faith from Google-view
confirms its existence in accord with the paced out survey<br>
that was made.&nbsp; Beyond Salcey Forest it may be shown that the Saltway
crosses the first of a few major rivers at Olney - entering<br>
the town along Spring Lane which opens in the square and crossing Viatores route
175 at right angles as it aligns with Olney's<br>
back streets.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">* a new mapping technique (see <a href="http://www.bluesky-world.com/">Bluesky
- &quot;Surface Model&quot;</a>)
provides visibility of surface slopes. This crop-mark is <a href="ridge.jpg">definitely
ridged<br>
</a>and by use of analysis software (Global Mapper v.12.02) the DSM data shows
the ridge height as a gradual ~12 centimetres with<br>
the trackway debris now spread over a band across the field some 35 metres
wide.&nbsp; The feature is totally invisible to anyone<br>
visiting the area (note made 09/04/2013) and there was not found any soil colour or stone distribution.
A further point of interest is that<br>
the path was cranked after it was following a straight-line and the SMJ railway
was built <u> after the crank</u>. This <a href="path-railway.jpg">1882 OS map with details</a><br>
and later path of the railway proves the point or at least defines the age of
the make-up of the road (giving a visible soilmark) to either<br>
(1) a post railway and pre-arable time by a farmer wanting to straighten his
route (unlikely ?) or (2) before the definition of what appears to be<br>
ridings through woodland that presumably prevailed well before enclosure - ie.
someone cut a line through a moorland or scrubland or<br>
a wood.&nbsp; In the former case, the Saltway must have lost its directivity
amidst coppices and divers divisions in the forest. In the latter, it was<br>
vectored&nbsp;towards a location within.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">In <a href="Salcey&#32;features.jpg">this image</a>
is shown the suggested Saltway path in relation to known Salcey Forest
archaeology.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">A bit of a problem for this proposal is that
the portion of the track from Ashwood to the crossroads is not apparent on an
18C<br>
map of Salcey Forest, but nor are any other subdividing tracks except for
Grafton's track which ran from the crossroads into<br>
the lawn area - continuing the line of the Hartwell road.&nbsp; This may be only
a medieval trackway.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3">The Viatores say that spur 172B peters out
just to the east of the village of Ashton.&nbsp; They remark that railway works
etc. make it<br>
impossible to take the line further but: &quot;</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The
left fork 172B makes a brave start towards Hartwell, beside a stretch of county<br>
boundary to the north-west of Spinney Lodge. It is conspicuous along the
boundaries of three more fields, and attains high ground<br>
on merging into the modern road, where it makes a slight turn more
west-north-west. The farmer at Park Farm indicated its<br>
presence on the east side of his house, believing that the original road was
taken up and relaid as a present track into the<br>
Ashton road. There is just sufficient evidence to carry it across the ford to
the east of the railway, but the village plan is so altered<br>
by the passage of the enormous railway embankment that the search had to be
terminated. On the line ahead is a group of<br>
Romano-British sites around Blisworth, in which direction continuation might
profitably be sought.&quot;&nbsp; The group of sites around<br>
Blisworth are displayed on a <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/romanfinds.htm">map of
Roman Monumental Records</a> on this website.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The large google-based layout
below shows that 172B could be joined up with &quot;our Saltway&quot; given that
the eastern part of Knock<br>
Lane is taken as part of the Saltway.&nbsp; Simply extending its line through
Roade brings alignment within a short distance.&nbsp; The Viatores<br>
arrived at A in the layout from the east with 172B and a short length extending
from that, following hedges etc. provides potential<br>
for a joining.&nbsp; The labels '<b>m</b>' refer to lengths of track that have been
metalled (use of compressed pebbles).</font>&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">There is however a<br>
logical problem with this route for
the Saltway because it suggests that, having traced a line between due east and
east-south-east<br>
for many miles from Droitwich,
an excursion from fork F on the 172 south-east to nearly rejoin the
Watling Street simply doesn't<br>
make
much sense because the Saltway crossed the Watling Street at Fosters
Booth.&nbsp; In short
The Viatores indicate no routes in the<br>
area running substantially
east-west other than from the area of Little Brickhill and so a path near Olney,
crossing the river there and<br>
heading for the Bedford area, is
somewhat more favoured.&nbsp; Perhaps there was a route from Olney to provide a
north-easterly<br>
extension for the road numbered 170b in the diagram above.&nbsp; The Viatores
say nothing about this possibility in their book</font></p>

T<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">he route indicated in purple,
added in 2012, was suggested in Bryant's 1824 map; the<br>
north end aligned in view
of the appearance of
early 19C Roade and the rest aligning very<br>
well with road and some field
boundaries.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Final Comments:
The tracks across Salcey, including the one suggested in the map above,<br>
existed
as earthen balks.&nbsp; Maps before about 1750 cannot be
found.&nbsp; Continuation through<br>
or slightly to the north of Stoke Goldington
can be plausibly suggested but no field work to<br>
try confirm this
has been done.&nbsp; Once passed Olney further pure speculation is needed<br>
before
linking up with the Viatores track 222 to Sandy.&nbsp; Beyond
Sandy a division onto the<br>
south and north parts of track way 22 seem to spell
the end of the speculation.&nbsp; It is worth bearing in mind that
salt trading on a line<br>
persistently to the east must peter out as one approaches
the influence of salt sources on the east coast.&nbsp;</font></p>
