        of Blisworth Arm, 1939 - 46</b></font></p>

        Arm</a></span></font>

        <p align="center"><font color="#000080"><b>John Dale</b></font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 25; padding-right: 25"><font color="#000080">I was born in Soho, London, in
        1934 and moved
        with my family to Blisworth Arm in 1939.&nbsp; My father, Ernest George
        Dale, was hired by the UK government and we were accommodated in the
        house of the canal company's area manager - Charles Hadlow, being the &quot;Toll House&quot;
        by the bridge, while Hadlow was away presumably
        for the war.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 25; padding-right: 25"><font color="#000080">My father's job was to find warehouse storage
        for emergency supplies of food and oversee the importing of goods and
        its transportation by canal, probably mostly via London docks, to the
        warehouses.&nbsp; One of the chief warehouses was the empty corn mill
        belonging to the Grand Union Canal Carrying Company at the bridge in
        Blisworth so an obvious location for organising canal transport was the
        GUCCCo. boatyard at the Arm.&nbsp; My father was partnered with a guy
        from the yard, I think he was the foreman Jack.&nbsp; Another guy was
        brought in to help with day to day boatyard duties as Jack was busy with
        my father.&nbsp; Jack had a
        little old Morris and the two of them frequently went off looking at
        stock or for more warehouses.&nbsp; The collection of the strategic
        stocks of food was part of the plans to offset food shortages if the
        success of the German U-boats had become unbearably high. [<i>the
        function of the mill in the war years became known to villagers - there
        are a few anecdotes in the <a href="../BlisworthMill.htm">Blisworth Mill
        page</a> and in the <a href="../BBook/BBook.html">out-of-print book on
        Blisworth</a> - George Freeston found much paperwork in the canal office
        at the Arm and this is amassed at the N.R.O.</i>].</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 25; padding-right: 25"><font color="#000080">I went to school at Blisworth and remember the
        headmaster Mr. Cole.&nbsp; I remember school-organised efforts to help
        the economy, for example cutting and saving nettles.&nbsp; In 1945 I
        passed an entrance exam and went to Northampton Grammar School,
        travelling there and back daily by bus.&nbsp; I recall playing around
        the Arm area and it still amazes me that, in the warm summers, we bathed
        in the canal.&nbsp; It seems remarkable in that nobody suffered from
        disease despite the canal being more like a sewer than a river. [<i>it
        was routine then for families on boats and <a href="Arm&#32;and&#32;Canal.htm"> some of the houses</a> to
        discharge all waste straight into the canal</i>].</font></p>

          <p style="padding-left: 25; padding-right: 25">
          <font color="#000080">The brewer who owned the large house had a
          French name, a wife and 2 daughters and I played with one of the
          daughters who was my age.&nbsp; [<i>the brewer was <a href="../neighbour-one.htm#1949inn">Mr.
          Brabs Baillion</a>, a senior manager with Phipp's Brewery, Northampton,
          that owned most of the small pubs and inns in this area.&nbsp; Mr.
          Baillion became well-known in the village in the 1960s as he was a
          councillor for a few years</i>]&nbsp; On Saturdays I, at 7 years old,
          was hired by the local farmer, <a href="../neighbour-one.htm#1949inn">Bill
          Whitlock</a>, to help drive his bullock herd the 5 miles to the
          Northampton&nbsp;&nbsp;market, first to Milton and then along the main
          road.&nbsp; We left at first light, walked to the market, took care of
          the stock until 3 pm and then took any which weren't sold and walked
          them back to the Arm.&nbsp; My wages were 2 shillings and sixpence for
          the day. Great deal!&nbsp; On</font> <font color="#000080">Sundays I
          often helped one of the farmer's employees hunting rabbits in the
          warrens and invariably got to take home one for dinner.</font>
          <p style="padding-left: 25; padding-right: 25"><font color="#000080">I certainly agree that there were some
          supplies intended for the mills&nbsp;which slid off to a &quot;couple of
          odd
          destinations&quot;.&nbsp; Jack and my Dad especially did 'rounds' on
          the weekends when no other staff were around.&nbsp; I do remember when
          a couple of friends sent a couple of tons of tea to the Arm.&nbsp; My
          father felt that it was illegal.&nbsp; He wanted to protect his
          buddies and during one night poured out the tea, dumping it all in the
          canal.&nbsp; The problem was it wouldn't sink and next morning the sun
          came up to a couple of miles of tea on the surface of the
          canal.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the war, Dad's job came to an end and
          he was hired by the C.C.G., ie. the Control Commission for
          Germany.&nbsp; He was posted to Duisburg in Germany to re-organise
          their canals in the reparation effort.&nbsp; That's another bunch of
          stories.&nbsp; At first my mother and I moved into a boarding house,
          basically one of the larger cottages, on
          the High Street, Blisworth, that was operated by an Irish lady of
          rather powerful build [<i>no success so far in identification</i>].&nbsp; At the end of
          1946 we also left and then joined father in Duisburg.&nbsp; I now find
          myself in Canada, indeed I have been living here for 40 years.</font></p>
