        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">We
        moved into No. 4, Ford Lane (later 38, Station Road) in August 1948.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>My father had changed his job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He had been Station Master at two country stations in
        Leicestershire during the war and just after, but then he became
        passenger rep for British Rail, based in Northampton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A house was available in the SMJ cottages and my parents took it,
        even though it was a bit primitive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There was no electricity to begin with and no bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We had to use oil-lamps and cooking was done on the range in the
        living room which provided the only heating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">After
        a year or so BR improved the cottages – we got electricity!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It was only one light fitting in the middle of the ceiling and
        one socket per room but at least it was better than oil-lamps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And we could have an electric stove in the kitchen. The house was
        redecorated as well – the work done by a contractor called Preedy and
        his painter/decorator was called Tommy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He was not the hardest working character and was always sloping
        off for a cigarette.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had
        a terrible smokers’ cough which he blamed on his “bronicals”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        previous occupant of No. 4 had been Sammy Hancox, a retired engine
        driver on the SMJ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        other houses were occupied by railway people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>At No. 3 were <a href="../People-two.htm#barden">the Robsons</a>,
        he also was a retired engine driver for the SMJ; at No. 2 were the Hicks
        family, he was a signalman at the Gayton box on the main line; at No. 1
        were the Dicken family, he worked at the carriage and wagon works at
        Wolverton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">Each
        house had a piece of land to use as an allotment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Ours was kept as a conventional garden and later my father built
        a garage there and also a greenhouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Robsons had several apple trees on their land which they said
        were seedlings they had grown themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I have no idea of the variety but they were delicious and very
        tempting for the train-spotters who congregated the other side of the
        railway bridge, at the top of the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We often caught them scrumping the apples, but I could understand
        the temptation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        Hicks’ kept a few hens on their allotment as well as a splendid array
        of fruit and veg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        Dickens’ allotment was never used much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Beyond the houses, going towards the station and hidden in trees
        and undergrowth was the large cesspit which served the houses; this was
        forbidden territory for children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beyond
        that there was a long stretch of land used frequently as a wood-yard,
        and just before the station was an enclosed area occasionally used to
        assemble animals due to be moved by train.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I remember once seeing a large group of horses waiting there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">We
        were never sure where the name “Ford Lane” came from* – but about
        half way along the lane a very small stream had been culverted under the
        road, so I suppose that was its origin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">In
        those days much of our food was delivered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Cowley’s the butcher delivered each week, and later the Co-op
        in Northampton sent round a large van on Saturday mornings; there was a
        choice of bakers – we had one from Gayton to begin with and later
        changed to Sturgess’s and a grocer in Northampton sent a rep (Mr.
        Tranter) round once a fortnight to collect an order delivered a few days
        later. A fishmonger called every few weeks and my mother almost always
        chose whiting, to be steamed in milk.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A van with fruit and veg came round also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Getting food delivered was simply the only practical way to shop
        in the days before supermarkets and universal car use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        the Lane was just a field access road and is shown on 1729 maps fording
        the stream mentioned, which was the water used by the watermill at the
        bottom of Chapel Lane (Mill Lane).</span></font>
