<p align="center"><b>&quot;An Experience of a Coffin-maker's Boy&quot; - as
recalled by Witty Whitlock for George in the 1960s</b></p>
<p>When I got home from school, Mother said, &quot;Father's got a job for
you&quot;. &quot;What's that then?&quot; &quot;It's to take a little coffin up
to the Stone Works&quot;. So I went down to see Father, in his workshop, and he
said, &quot;It will be ready in half an hour&quot; - he brought the coffin up
ready for the house and I started up the Stoke Road with it under my arm. I had
got to call on <a href="../People.htm#granny"> Granny Davis</a> who was the village 'layer out' - &quot;She'll take
you there and put
you right&quot;. Granny Davis took me upstairs at the Stoneworks and said &quot;Wait
there, I'll be back in a minute&quot;. She came back with some whisky and a
couple of glasses. After we had had some whisky she said she knew where the
infant was. I handed her the coffin and she 'put everything alright'. &quot;Tell
your father that everything is alright&quot;. I said, &quot;Alright&quot;. So
then she said that we better have a little drop more whisky before you go. So I
had another drop. She said she was going to stop there a little while and I set
off back by the football field where there was a deep ditch. And I fell headlong
into it. When I got home, Mother said &quot;Are you well? Have you been having
any drink?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Ooh!! well you better go to bed
then&quot; I never woke till she called me at half past seven next day.
&quot;You getting up?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; - and I happily went to school, in
Courteenhall, as usual. I landed home at night and told Mother that I was
alright and that was the end of a perfect day.</p>
