steady that nothing appears in the log of any village mood or tragedy in the
span of the war. He reports his day to day successes and problems in a
business-like manner. Many of his entries, which have been copied verbatim (with
a few exceptions) are food for thought indeed.</p>

 The following information has been obtained from Michael Gibson's book.&nbsp;
In 1912 the Army and Navy established a Military Wing with HQ at Farnborough and
in 1913 a base was established at Montrose near Aberdeen.&nbsp; Squadron No.2
was to be transferred to Montrose for both training and as an experiment in
mobility.&nbsp; The transfer was not well organised and Capt. JWH Becke was
obliged to land near Blakesley on Feb 18, 1913 for more fuel before finally
landing at Tiffield.&nbsp; The photograph shows his aeroplane - a B.E.2a number
217 under guard.&nbsp; He was joined by three more in the next three days.&nbsp;
Poor weather delayed their departure northwards.&nbsp; Local residents were able
to see more Army flyers in the following months.&nbsp; Michael Gibson also
details the visit made by George V in order to inspect Army manoeuvres in the
county.

</P><P>Further information garnered from a variety of websites:&nbsp; The BE stood for
'Bl<font SIZE="2">é</font>riot Experimental' although M. Bl<font SIZE="2">é</font>riot had
nothing to do with this aircraft which was in fact manufactured by de Havilland
from 1912.&nbsp; The reference to Bl<font SIZE="2">é</font>riot arises from an
early use of a &quot;tractor&quot; propeller rather than a pusher
propeller.&nbsp; The BE2 was an extremely stable machine used for reconnaissance and bombing, carrying up to 100 lb bombs. It actually took part in bombing raids. With the increase in counter-air activities in early 1915, the type was soon relegated to second line duties
such as training.

</P><P>It has been pointed out that the chimney stacks in the background of this
picture are
part of some brickworks on the Towcester side of the village of Tiffield.

</P><P>From the extract below, it seems that the trip north from Farnborough was
marked by other landings!&nbsp; This perhaps enabled Blisworth people to be
tipped-off on February 13th and again on the 17th. Mr. Sunderland, Northampton,
gave a talk on the preparations for an anticipated WWI in 1913-14. In addition
to much activity as noted by the school children over flying machines, there
were manoeuvres by soldiers heading north from Alderton, via Easton Neston, to
Towcester going on with airmen attempting to spy on them. King George arrived on
horseback at the Elm and was questioned by a few villagers as to what was going
on - &quot;I am watching my soldiers&quot; he replied.

</P><P>The 1912 - 13 activity by what was essentially the beginnings of the RAF,
were preceded by aviation over the County in 1910.&nbsp; Note the Northampton <a href="1954-News.htm#aviation">Independent
article referred to elsewhere</a>.

</P><P><b><u>MORE PICTURES</u></b>

</P><P>Further photographs kindly provided by Peter Butcher, Gayton.&nbsp; They
indicate that at least<br>
two types were used at Tiffield.&nbsp; The second sort, shown below uses a
&quot;pusher&quot; propeller <br>
and, at present, its type is not known.
