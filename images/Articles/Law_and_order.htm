<p align="center"><b><font color="#000080" size="6">LAW AND ORDER</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the early years of the Blisworth Parish Council three people were
nominated and voted on as Parish Constables each year. Their job, alongside
their trade or profession, was to maintain law and order among the villagers and
for this they were generally unpaid.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The practice stemmed from Norman times where suitable men would be sworn in at
the Court Leet sessions and this was a function taken over in the late 18th
century by the Church Vestry meetings. Such meetings in fact continued until 1896 when our
Parish Council was first formed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Issues regarding maintaining law and order were raised at the 'Court Leets'
which were meetings called by the Lord of the Manor and those in Blisworth were
probably held in the Royal Oak, attended by an agent for the Duke of Grafton.
The general business at the Court Leets included the confirmation of three
constables for the ensuing year and generating sometimes ad hoc rules for
keeping the land fit for cultivation - the land being divided into three large
fields, before inclosure, that were shared between all households. The banks, or
baulks, between sections of the fields may have needed altering or building up
and the stream might have needed clearing.</font></p>

the first time then a new rule would be added to the rather long list. The NRO
holds a few copies of Court Leet minutes from the early 18th century and an inspection of
them shows only the new rules and that every rule carried a monetary penalty for those who might ignore
it. With any change in 'welfare' of a particular piece of ground it might be
decided to alter its position in the generally strictly-kept rules for crop
rotation. &nbsp; Other tasks at the
Court Leets is to review the list of those to receive poor relief and elect the
minor parish officials.&nbsp; See the table below for the duties of these
officers, who effectively impose an 'order' upon village society though in
many cases not all of them would be necessary.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The records are signed by a customary twelve
men - members of the Leet Jury, being the origin of our jury system.&nbsp; The inset below is copied from a 1740
Court Leet record - nearly all the names are familiar ones.&nbsp; In that year, Richard Gibbs
was elected constable and Charles Brayfield and John Hedge were made
thirdboroughs, showing that not being on the Leet jury had no affect on eligibility.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><img height="573" src="jury.jpg" width="256" align="left">
 Of the various roles described in the table, the minutes of our early parish
council mention the work of the constables, the poor overseer and the surveyor
though it is evident that the latter two soon became the concern of the County
Council based at Towcester - with some details in the next two paragraphs.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">At first the highways surveyor's office at Towcester
also included matters of sanitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is known that previously,
the church vestry meetings must have dealt with this topic, for the parish council in 1896 'inherited' a <a href="../Sanitation/sewage-water.htm">scheme
of 15 cesspits</a>.&nbsp; In medieval times, there appears to have been no
specific officer reporting to the
Court Leet on matters of sanitation - the scavenger is closest!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The parish council continued for many years the distributions to the poor if
originating from
payments made by custom (eg. Duke of Grafton) or from a trust (eg. the Leeson Charity)
and this was with the guidance of the Churchwardens of the
parish.&nbsp; But in fact, for those Blisworth records in the NRO, it was land management
that was the most important item in the
agenda - far outweighing everything else.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Returning to law and order, the constables had a right of discretion and would
punish offenders by locking them in stocks or possibly in a 'Little Ease' for a
spell and report the matter at the next Court Leet. There might be a review of
an individual in terms of some worse punishment to be metered out to him the next
time. It seems Blisworth Parish had a Little Ease, for the erection of the
Baptists' Chapel in 1825 <a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm#2"> was on a field with that
name</a>. Our earliest map, 1729,
shows nothing of this. A Little Ease is a box or chamber, sometimes underground,
into which an offender would be locked. The inside dimensions were neither high
enough to stand nor wide enough to sit - the object being to torture the
individual with as little ease (comfort) as possible. If the prisoner was
unpopular and the box was underground, villagers would try to suffocate him by
covering him.&nbsp; Of the village stocks little is known except to say that
stocks are also known as 'Little Ease'.&nbsp; George Freeston has stated that stocks were placed at the turn in
the Courteenhall Road (where the path joins the road) but nothing in writing has
yet turned up.&nbsp; There are more details of the duties of the constable(s) in
the <a href="Law_and_order.htm#appendix">Appendix below</a>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The swearing in of village constables seems to have faded out
just before the second World War, by which time no-one could be found prepared
to do the job.&nbsp; By that time uniformed professional police had been adopted
across the
country.&nbsp; This national force was supposed to have taken shape since about
1860.&nbsp; Hints of it are notable in 1905.&nbsp; In the transitional period the relationship between the two policing
forces was somewhat strained where each accused the other of incompetence. Stories of policing in general are scarce but here
is a delightful one:-&nbsp; it concerned a traditional parish constable, Mr. Gooch, who
needed to take a man to Towcester prison. Off they went, handcuffed together,
and as they walked down the hill by Showsley, the prisoner's hat blew off. He
requested that he be released to recover his hat. 'No' said Gooch 'you will just
run off. Stay here and I will get it instead'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gooch innocently undid the cuffs to
walk off and get the
hat.&nbsp; Of course - the prisoner ran off.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">During WWII Constable Fred Wooding received a distressed call from a woman who was
on the railway embankment when a German aeroplane strafed her with bullets.
'Don't worry madam, I’m on my way immediately on my bicycle!&quot;&nbsp; The strafing
was almost certainly aimed not at her but at the railway station, which
certainly accumulated some <a href="Law_and_order.htm#war">bullet holes during the war</a>.&nbsp;
Fred Wooding 'worked with' the youth at the time; one clever boy who put some
small fish in a bucket of water, which had been filled at the pump and laboriously
carried home, was followed into school and made to promise to get the guy his
water for a whole week; there was an incident where apple scrumpers would be met at the orchard fence
in Chapel Lane and made to
empty their shirts into his bicycle-saddlebag - the boys were left to wonder
whether there was a dark side to P.C. Wooding who then cycled straight past the orchard
owner's house on his rounds which included Gayton.&nbsp; One day, a couple of
lads stole his bike and hid it.&nbsp; They dared not return it and pretty soon
the police force replaced it.&nbsp; Then, a few days later, knowing that Wooding
was visiting a certain woman, because his new bike was lent against the
telephone box, the lads returned his bike and lent it against his new one.&nbsp;
They then vanished and so cannot report on any further events in that
story.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There is another story which involved one of our
village constables, 'Woody' Colin Wood. He was
shocked to find after dark in Towcester a camel loping along the main street pavement and,
once recovered sufficiently, he had the presence of mind to tether it to a
lamp-post. The local newspaper joked that a 'ship of the desert had slipped its
moorings and that the constable had got the hump . . .' but the matter was
resolved when a circus manager turned up and reclaimed the animal before
morning.&nbsp; It is hoped to include one or two more stories before too long.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">We still think, wistfully, of a constable walking his beat, keeping a wary
eye out for trouble and stepping in sometimes to make an authoritative and
diplomatic point - and in a country area such as ours, able to forge a good
relationship with many of the youth of the village.&nbsp; The &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; image is never
enacted these days - this village has been administered from Daventry Police
Station (since about 1990) and before that from Towcester Police Station (since
about 1975).&nbsp; Blisworth is one of 17 villages administered by one of the
groups at Daventry.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The traditional parish Constables obviously lived in the village.&nbsp; Early
in the 19th century, a professional Constable Heath lived in the High Street in a
tied house now
numbered No.14 having been transferred there from Yardley Gobion in about
1905.&nbsp; We know this because Heath's elderly daughter wrote to George
Freeston in November 1981.&nbsp; One of his successors, name unknown now, was so
tall the floor of that house had to be dug out to accommodate him.&nbsp; This was the house
that was formerly the greengrocer shop of the Alexander family, until about
1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1940s Constable Fred Wooding, nicknamed 'Charcoal', lived in the centre house of the group of three at the lower end
of Church Lane (<a href="../New&#32;Houses/ChurchLane/Church&#32;Lane.htm">no longer</a>
a semi-derelict house) which was duly referred to as the Police
Station - presumable another tied house.&nbsp; In about 1953, the County police force provided
a new tied house that was built in the High Street next to the
newsagent's shop and at about this time P.C. Wooding retired and 'Honest' John
Mitchell took over.&nbsp; That house then became known as the
Blisworth Police Station.&nbsp; It did not possess a blue light over the
door but there were &quot;Northamptonshire County Constabulary&quot; signs both
over the door and alongside where there was a notice board.&nbsp; Constable Colin Wood,
following Honest John from June 1966, was the last of the truly <i>village</i>
 bobbies - after 21 years he gave way to Constable Mick Knight, based at
Towcester but maintaining a contact with the village.&nbsp; It was at some time in the 1970s that the house was placed on the
open market and the administration was moved to Towcester.</font></p>

Country Parish&quot;, 1919 -<br>

<p align="center" style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><b><font size="3" color="#000080">Watch and Ward</font></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><font size="3" color="#000080">The work of the constable in the parish government has for its main characteristic that of a police
officer, a conservator of the peace.&nbsp; His duties were wide ranging as can
be seen from the following.&nbsp; However, a constable who either exceeded his
authority, or neglected his duties, was liable to severe penalties from the
sheriff or Justice of the Peace.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><font size="3" color="#000080">If a quarrel broke out in his presence he must not let it go
too far: when words ran high he must warn the disputants before they came to
blows. He must discriminate as to what exactly was the distinction between a
lawful and an unlawful assembly of people, and in the latter case he must
command it to disperse. He must listen to all complaints, and decide whether a
suspected person were guilty enough to justify a warrant of arrest, and, having
arrested a man, he must keep him in safe custody until the day of trial. It was
also his duty to see that the various statutes passed for the good ordering of
mankind were not violated in his township; there must be no cursing and
swearing, no unlawful games, no sitting tippling in alehouses, no eating of
flesh on fast days, no profaning of the Sabbath Day, either by absence from
church or by unlawful work; but every man must provide himself with suitable
arms; the fathers must teach their sons the use of the bow; parents must bind
their children apprentice; masters and servants must be content to give and
receive neither more nor less than the wage laid down by the Justices of the
Peace. Rogues and vagabonds must be summarily sent to their native places;
minstrels and wandering players of interludes must not be allowed to corrupt the
King's liege people; wherever a market was held, the various trade regulations
affecting corn, butter, malt, weights and measures, etc., must be enforced. In
short, the constable must apprehend, take charge of and present for trial all
persons who broke the laws, written or unwritten, against the King's peace or
against the statutes of the realm, and, when judgment was delivered, in many
cases he had to inflict the punishment or levy the fine.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><font size="3" color="#000080">All rogues and vagabonds found begging, hedge-breakers,
robbers of orchards and gardens, cutters of corn and wood, apprentices who had
misbehaved themselves, were to be summarily whipped by the constable at the
bidding of a Justice of the Peace, and should this unfortunate amateur policeman
refuse to execute this part of his work, he could be sent to prison.&nbsp; To
avoid breaches of the peace, to prevent visitations of the plague through
infected people, it was necessary that someone should always be on the look out
to prevent suspicious characters from entering the township; thus an important
daily or weekly duty of the constable was the appointing of suitable people for
the watch since he was the man to blame if anything went wrong. </font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><font size="3" color="#000080">The constable had moreover to carry out sentences inflicted on
offenders by the Justices of the Peace, acting separately, together, or in
Quarter Sessions, or by the Leet in places where the Courts Leet were still
held. He must also execute the commands of the Justices of Gaol Delivery, of
Oyer and Terminer, and of the Coroners. If a fire broke out in the parish, the
constable had to be present to prevent any goods being stolen. If any particular
bit of work had to be done for the good of the whole village, the constable
commanded the various householders to come and give their labour.&nbsp; In some
cases he was the rate collector for the township, and was empowered to seize the
goods of any person refusing to pay an assessment, sell them, and take the money
for the rate, giving back to the owner the proceeds. He was associated with the
churchwardens in the administration of the Poor Law, and of the Statute of
Labourers and Apprentices. He was also the executive officer of the surveyor, in
that he must order people to come to their common days' work on the roads and
present them if they refused.</font></p>
<p align="center" style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><b><font size="3" color="#000080">Hue and Cry</font></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><font size="3" color="#000080">The constable had not only to prevent affrays in his township
but also to ensure that no breaker of the peace was allowed to escape. If a
felon, or even a person suspected of felony, fled out of, or came into, the
township, the constable was expected to take the initiative in raising the
alarm, for he alone had legal authority to enforce his orders, he alone could
and did present at the Quarter Sessions anyone who disobeyed him. When the
constable raised the hue and cry, all the inhabitants of the township had to
take part in it on horseback and on foot. They turned out of their homes with
knives, bows and arrows—those weapons which they were expected to keep ready
for such emergencies—and crying, &quot;Out, Out,&quot; blowing their horns
with shouting and uproar streamed after the fugitive. As the noise travelled
over into the next township, so its constable must make his people take up the
pursuit: thus &quot;the hue will be horned from vill to vill.&quot; If a
murderer escaped, the township was fined for negligence, if a robbery was
committed, and no township in the wapentake (shire-hundred) had captured the
thief, the whole wapentake was held responsible and an assessment was levied on
it to pay to the person robbed the value of the stolen goods: moreover every
wapentake through which the thief fled had to take its share in making good the
loss.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 45; padding-right: 40"><font size="3" color="#000080">In days when there were no banks men travelled about with
large sums of money and it was very necessary to enforce the local
responsibility of maintaining security from robbery.&nbsp; But while the
township or the wapentake had to make recompense as a penalty for negligence, if
a constable let a man accused of felony escape while in his custody he himself
became a felon and &quot;the judges of his fault may set his fine equal with the
value of all his goods if in their discretions his defaults do so
require.&quot;&nbsp; Generally, therefore, an arrested person was placed for
safety in the village stocks until he could be taken before the nearest Justice
or conveyed to jail. If he escaped out of the township, then the constable must
