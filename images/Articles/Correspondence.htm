<p style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">The letters span the period from
July 1899 to October 1900, post marked via Towcester at a 1d. rate and generally
sent weekly.&nbsp; The hand they are written in is very well schooled.&nbsp; The
writer was a young lady from a remote village and the recipient was a young
Blisworth man who had begun an apprenticeship in Northampton and was in 'digs'
in the south part of the town.&nbsp; We are trying to locate the family of the
recipient with a view to returning the letters.</font></p>

transcribed here to serve as a commentary on those times and the use of language.&nbsp;
The names of individuals have all been changed.</b><br>
<b>Eastcote July 4, 1899</b> &quot;.. I did think you would have come either
Monday or Tuesday night. I did not expect you on Sunday when it was
wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; You said when I have a bike I shall come over in the week but
you have never been yet but I expect you have so much to take your attention in
the town.&nbsp; Out of sight out of mind I believe its so with you but I mean to
enjoy myself this next week or two we think of going out Saturday afternoon ..
your ever loving wench &amp;c&quot;.<br>
<b>July 26</b> &quot;I feel I must write a line just to know how you are.&nbsp;
I do hope you are better. I can't forget your poor thin face I hope you will
send me a line back just to ease my mind.&nbsp; B Hornsby has done his bit at
Milton poor.&nbsp; Bert don't like work I think they set him digging post holes
and it blistered his hands ... good bye for now &amp;c&quot;<br>
<b>November 9, 1899</b> &quot; ... I shall expect you and I will come and meet
you up Gaton (sic) Fields and if you don't come I shall say something I ought

<b>Sunday afternoon</b> &quot; ... our Ozzy tells me if you don't soon come to
see me I shall be going off my head.&nbsp; I shall come and see your landlady if
she has got a spare bed for one night if she has not I can take Ben's place. ...
I must close now and go and get the tea, Loving&quot;<br>
<b>December 5, 1999</b> &quot; ... It was lovely at Chapel, I sat close to Mr
Davis who quite drowned my little voice, thank you for the violets I have put
them in water just for the sake of you.&nbsp; Flo has a skinned wrist and she
said her mother told her to put some Vasiline on and she said to ask you whitch
(sic) would be the best Vasiline or ice cream she said you would know what was
best for sore places.&nbsp; Hope see you again Sunday &amp;c.&quot;<br>
<b>January 21, 1900</b> &quot;I went to Pattishall today and Ike's wife called
me in to see the baby.&nbsp; She had got it naked its a nice child I think it
was a boy but I'm not much of a judge it looked a fat little thing.&nbsp; Miss
Flo wishes to be remembered to you and she said she would love to have a go at
you.&nbsp; She is quite saucy her dreams she has had this last week are
awful.&nbsp; I tell her she must be thinking about nauty (sic) things ...&quot;<br>
<b>March 15, 1900</b> &quot;... Our Bill has seen about a bike for me but I
don't know if I shall have it in time.&nbsp; ... you would just laugh to see me

the saddle hurts so I must be very tender.&nbsp; I have heard that G Tuckley is
coming back to work at Graham's.&nbsp; From your ever true &amp;c.&quot;<br>

he wanted to take me for a walk and I told him I had one.&nbsp; .. he is a
butcher and I see quite enough butchering.&nbsp; If you see Annie Massey just
give her my love..&quot;&nbsp; <i>[Massey - a Blisworth family in the Westley
Buildings]<br>
</i><b>October 2, 1900</b> &quot;...Fanny will be taken down a bit before
long.&nbsp; Her man is a chap who earns about 8 shillings a week.&nbsp; I know where
he lodges and my cousin says he is an idle young beggar he don't like work so
you see what a catch she will have and he is only 18 years old.&nbsp; He has
about 3 letters a week so you see they are very strong on.... PS.&nbsp;&nbsp; I must tell you
I had my Ma very bad last week.&nbsp; I was in a way I can tell you but she is
better now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm so glad I did feel frightened.&nbsp; See you soon

<p style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">This newspaper was a 20pp publication of about 'Daily Mail' size.&nbsp;
The paper seems to be edited for a non-conformist readership, so perhaps the
recipient's family were Baptists.&nbsp; [In fact, the head of the household <i>was</i>
admitted to the Baptist church in 1870 - as discovered recently]&nbsp; The
four side centre-fold is badly crumpled and very dirty so that copying is ruled
out.&nbsp; Below there are three short religious articles and then three quack
(?) adverts recorded here out of general interest.&nbsp; The first article includes
an early use of the expression
'wind-up' in noun form, it seems to mean 'a situation that one ends up in'
rather than an annoying joke.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER" style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">Concerning Short Cuts</font></p>
</b>
<p style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">Most Alpine climbers have their story of a short cut. In a new bit of country
they see a route which appears quicker and simpler than the regular one, and
take it. At the end<i> </i>of the day they are congratulating themselves that
they got off with a journey of double length and without </font><font color="#0000FF">
the wind-up</font><font color="#000080">, which more than once seemed imminent, </font><font color="#0000FF"> of
a broken neck</font><font color="#000080">. The short cut succeeds sometimes, but not often. It is, as
a rule, ventured on in inexperience and impatience, and turns out in nine cases
out of ten to be the wrong road. And this experience is not limited to
excursions over moor and mountain. In the wider region of life, where mind and
heart are making their perpetual pilgrimages, the same thing obtains. Here also
Lessing's word is constantly being proved that 'it is not true that the shortest
line is always the straight one.' <i> [it continues ...]</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><b><font color="#000080">Bulletin</font></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><font size="3" color="#000080">Rome has followed Paris in forming an <i>'Association of
Prayers and Good Works for the Return of Great Britain to Catholic Unity'.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
France and Italy are practically lost to Rome through scepticism, and the
statesmen of the Vatican think (not without reason, perhaps) that the best
chances of propagandism are in the countries where Romanism is least
known.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this subject Dr. Horton's sermon on <i>'Romanism and
National Well-being'</i> reported in this week's <i>Christian World Pulpit</i>,
is an instructive commentary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately for England there lives in
it a vigorous and growing Nonconformity which is safeguarded against all the
blandishments of an aesthetic sacerdotalism, and the heart of the country is as
Protestant as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'crusade of prayer<sup>'</sup> has a stiff task to make England again, as Cardinal Parrocelli, the Pope's
Vicar-General, said was the object, <i>'the Dowry of the Blessed Virgin Mary'.&nbsp;
[The Romanising of the Anglican church was <a href="../Chapel/chapel-history1875.htm#roman"> of concern to the Blisworth baptists
too</a> in 1875]</i></font></p>
<p align="center" style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><font size="3" color="#000080"><b>Comment</b></font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60; padding-right: 60"><font size="3" color="#000080">Mr. Pecksniff was not the first man nor the last to use prayer
as a weapon of offence. A London vicar, if a daily newspaper's report is
correct, resorted to the method on Sunday morning. His church, is 'High' and
some members of the Protestant Brigade attended. The vicar recognised them and
informed the congregation. They had come, he said, in a spirit of hostility, and
perhaps to laugh and scoff. He invited the congregation to pray that those
misguided persons might be converted from the error of their ways and be led to
the truth. The congregation obeyed the behest, and prayed audibly, with the
result that the Protestants beat a retreat. To most people it will seem that
such a use of prayer is profanation.</font></p>
