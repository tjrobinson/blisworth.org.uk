        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It was pointed out that it might be quite revealing
        to research our past dependence upon cups of tea.&nbsp; This website
        offered a useful starting point and a search through <i> Google</i>
        indexes
        yielded over 30 references to tea.&nbsp; An account of them follows
        here.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One general point is that it has often been the
        task of the Church and the 'Chapel' to organise tea at any special event
        in the village.&nbsp; These institutions have vacant rooms which are
        ideal for such pursuits and their advantage has been evident in recent
        times too; the Baptist Church now runs a small cafe on Tuesday mornings
        using the 'Baptist school room' but, although they offer tea, coffee,
        chocolate and cakes, the venue is named 'The Coffee Shop' consistent
        with a modern idiom.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Baptists, in their early years, received
        two sermons on the Sunday in the morning followed by two in the evening,
        with tea in between.&nbsp; This may not be to the modern taste but it
        reflects the Dissenters enthusiasm for preaching and teas.&nbsp; They
        also held a public tea meeting at each Sabbath School
        Festival.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right from the start the Baptists excelled with
        tea at any major event.&nbsp; In 1825 when the Baptist Chapel was first
        opened, there were between 300 and 400 people sitting down in the open
        air in front of the Chapel.&nbsp; Exactly who attended this tea is
        unclear, but it would certainly have included the pastor, guests,
        deacons, committee and Church members and their families. The labouring
        folk and the “poorer classes” were largely excluded from this –
        presumably not because of social status alone, though this was probably
        part of the reason – and a separate sixpenny tea was provided for them
        subsequently. There were 160 at this event, held in the Vestry and
        Schoolroom. It was described as an acknowledgement of their generous
        assistance.&nbsp; Later on, throughout the eighteen fifties and sixties
        and onwards, these teas were frequent. For example at a new pastor's
        ordination tea, which had to be held indoors because of the time of
        year, 230 people took tea in the vestry and the schoolroom.&nbsp; On the
        same day at the service, several people were unable get in because of
        the crowd.&nbsp; Later in the same year (1859) some 450 took tea in the
        Chapel and in front of it.&nbsp; Special services and teas were also the
        focus of the major celebrations in 1865 when the work to extend the
        chapel and associated buildings was completed.&nbsp; By the end of the
        19th century the attendance at the major teas was not quite so
        enthusiastic for reasons that are difficult to identify.&nbsp; Teas were
        not uniquely Baptist, however, and there were a number of events at
        which the Anglican Church organised teas, both as dispensed cups of tea
        and sit-down tea parties for villagers.&nbsp; There were a string of
        Royal celebrations such as coronations and jubillees as well as the
        occasional war celebrations (Napoleonic, WWI and WWII).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Fund raising tea parties were common enough
        too, for example the Red Cross party held at The Loundes to support our
        soldiers in 1916.&nbsp; Others extended into more modern times.&nbsp; A
        leaflet from 1950 indicates &quot;4.00pm Tea for children - please bring
        your own spoon, 4.30pm Tea for Old Age Pensioners, 5.00pm Tea for Adults
        (<i>presumed not OAPs!</i>) and will grown-ups please bring your own
        knives, forks, teaspoons, cups and saucers&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">In a simpler social context, away from any
        religious circle or any need for fund raising, tea drinking has clearly
        been an established part of our culture for many years.&nbsp; Young's grocer shop in the High
        Street sold loose tea from the day they opened in 1875 and by 1936,
        Oliver Young, was well known for the prize-winning special blends of tea
        that he created at 4s. 8d. per lb for his GOLD MEDAL tea in 1937
        (affordable only for the few?) whilst regular tea was about
        1s. 6d. per lb.&nbsp; He won what were known as 'trader's throphies'.&nbsp;
        A lad who grew up in Blisworth in the 1940s and 1950s has penned this
        poetic account of the shop.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40"><font color="#000080">&quot;It is Saturday morning and the time was
        then, and the boy opens the big grey doors and scurries in to the smell
        of hardware and paraffin, paint and bristle brushes.&nbsp; Tea, bacon,
        cheese and coffee aromas fill his nostrils, draw him in and make him
        feel at home. And many homes are here - all represented and shared over
        the counter stretching long and vast before him.&nbsp; For the heart of
        Blisworth beats here, where buckets hang from their ceiling hooks with
        pots, pans and cheese graters, sweets chocolates and cakes.&nbsp; What
        wonders lie among those shelves! He asks for his Mum's bread and a
        quarter of dividend tea and, with his errand complete, he disappears out
        through those big grey doors.&nbsp; In the still air his feet clipper-clap
        round the corner and out of sight.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">A girl who was a senior school monitor at the
        village school remembers being regularly sent to Abbott's shop in the Stoke Road
        because there the tea was cheaper and, anyway, the teachers couldn't
        abide the taste of &quot;Young's fancy blends.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Returning to the Victorian era for moment, it
        is recalled that a number of tea-rooms were set up in Blisworth, at
        least two in Bridge Street (High Street), lower down than Young's shop,
        and boys at the railway station touted with reminders that tea was
        cheaper there than at the hotel gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a while
        Blisworth was as a resort - not only the hotel gardens but also the
        village itself.&nbsp; The Northampton Mercury &amp; Herald in
        1863 stated, “Blisworth is irregular and straggling but is a pleasant
        and picturesque village. Gardens and trees intervene between the houses;
        there’s high elms and elders, roses in masses, brilliant tiger lilies,
        profuse wallflowers, dazzling geraniums and petunias to delight the eye
        and fill the air”.</font></p>

        Here's some miscellaneous memories from the past, collected from a
        variety of documents: &quot;...then the foursome
        withdrew to the neighbour's
        house where they partook of strong hot tea liberally laced with
        precious war time Scotch........one would play in the sun, and we sometimes
        would have tea with the table cloth playing in the wind, and
        wasps trespassing in the jam and cream........tea was very expensive -
        one family of twelve had two ounces of tea a week
        which was made to go round and reached the children in a very attenuated
        form........ I well remember having our last tea in the small
        room that was facing the station - then my mother
        collected the cups and saucers together to go to Birmingham.&nbsp; So we left
        with the furniture to
        be followed on behind us........ I went up to “Stone Steps” for tea
        ........our 'temperance union' (the Oddfellows?) held their grand fetes
        enlivened by their own brass bands and a large quantity of tea ........
        women were provided with cake and tea for their
        families and respectable inhabitants met for a dinner in the Grafton
        Arms Inn&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">And during the WWII years, when the old mill on the canal was being
        used for emergency storage of food, there must have been some black or
        grey market going on with the goods - &quot;I do remember when a couple of friends sent a
        couple of tons of tea to the Arm. My father felt that it was illegal. He
        wanted to protect his buddies and during one night poured out the tea,
        dumping it all in the canal. The problem was it wouldn't sink and next
        morning the sun came up to a couple of miles of tea on the surface of
        the canal.&quot;</font></p>
