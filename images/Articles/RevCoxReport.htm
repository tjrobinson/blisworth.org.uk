<p style="padding-left: 120"><b><font color="#000080">Report by the Rev. Cox of
Holdenby, c. 1896 to Blisworth Parish Council</font></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">Dear Sir,</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">Here is a rough report from me as to the nature and contents of the various
documents in the Church Chest.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">The
documents relative to the Town Lands are particularly interesting.&nbsp; From
these is it evident that the Lands were originally left in pre-Reformation days
for sustaining lights in the Church and for providing it with ornaments.&nbsp;
These lights not being for the purposes of utility, but lamps on tapers kept
burning before altars and statues for devotional purposes were considered to
come within the &quot;superstitiousness&quot; [sic] of legislation of Edward VI,
and so the Lands were forfeited to the Crown.&nbsp; Sufficient influence however
was brought to bear to get them out of private hands upon whom they had been
conferred, and to procure their restoration to the parish.&nbsp; The rental of
these Lands was then declared to be used for the repair of the Church, for the
sustenance of the poor and for other laudable purposes and placed in the hands
of trustees.&nbsp; When these trustees fell to sick, there being originally
twelve, the surviving trustees and heirs were to meet and fill up the
vacancies.&nbsp; There were a variety of indentures, .....ning in 1618 (most of
them late copies of the originals), appointing fresh trustees and reciting the
particular plots of ground in the open fields of Blisworth.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080"><a href="RevCoxReport.htm#docs">All these
documents</a>, pertaining to an ecclesiastical charity, undoubtedly belong to the
Rector and churchwardens.&nbsp; They are interesting but of no legal value
whatever, for the Inclosure Award is a positive readjustment behind which no one
can go.&nbsp; Even if, as often was the case, public or parish rights were not
duly considered or a fair equivalent given, no argument for anything better than
a grumble at possible selfish class legislation of the past can be based upon
it.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">Other
documents relate to a dispute in Edward VI time, 1552, as to rights of cutting
thorns on &quot;Blisworth Plain&quot;, a big common of some 700 acres.&nbsp; The
eviden... in abstract is given of several aged w..... of Roade and Blisworth.&nbsp;
These are exceptionally interesting from a local historical point of view and
belong to the Parish Council.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">Two other
documents, time of Queen Elizabeth, refer to a cottage on the waste evidently
procured by the parish for... Poor Law purposes.&nbsp; These belong to the
Parish Council.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">I was very
sorry to learn that the particular document of 1696 was not forthcoming.&nbsp;
If the Parish Authorities find it and care to send it I will make an abstract of
it and give any explanation within my power <i>[NRO 35pe/192]</i>.&nbsp; They
need not be afraid of trusting me.&nbsp; At the present moment I have ....
definitely more valuable documents than theirs belonging to the Dean and Chapter
of Peterborough, and of Lichfield and the Count of Derby.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">I am of
your service .....etc.&nbsp; I should make no charge to any village Council.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">Faithfully
Yours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J. Charles Cox.<a name="docs"></a></font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><i><font color="#FF0000">[The
documents were reviewed by George Freeston and Eileen Rose in the 1960s and a
copy of her transcription has been reformed in html format and <a href="Medieval&#32;Docs.htm">made
available on this website</a>.&nbsp; The above was transcribed by T Marsh&nbsp;&nbsp; January 2006 - a row of dots, thus ..... means word(s) or
part word missing]</font></i></p>
