<p><font color="#000080">By law it was required to register any house that was
used as a meeting house, particularly a meeting house for non-conformist
groups.&nbsp; The <a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm">Baptists of Blisworth</a>
registered a number of places as such in the 19th century.&nbsp; Notable is the
record of a Welseyan Methodist group registering a house, referred to as a
chapel, on <b> 6 April 1841</b> in the village centre.&nbsp; It has been a puzzle where
this house was located in the village until, in the Baptists notes of June 1859,
it is stated that there was a discussion at a Baptist Church Meeting on the <u>Methodists</u>
who were using the house opposite that of William Rockingham.&nbsp; Evidently
the noise from the house was causing a disturbance.&nbsp; Also in 1859, January
31 in fact, Benjamin Whitlock and his wife Elizabeth apply to join the Baptists
from what is described in the baptists notes as a very small band of Wesleyan
reformers.&nbsp; They had, in fact, joined by March 6, 1859 - perhaps the band did not survive long!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The location of the Methodist Chapel can be surmised
starting from the Grafton record that in 1838 Richard Rockingham lived at the
little house at the top of Little Lane (see <a href="../1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_TownEnd_1838.jpg">plots
61 and 61a</a> in the Grafton records and '<a href="../Highstone.htm#steamroller">steamroller
shed</a>' in the 20th century) and operated the windmill presumably on behalf of
<a href="../mills-blisworth.htm">
Ann Westley</a>.&nbsp; The 1841 census fails to confirm his house but records him,
aged 50, at the windmill with a relative called Charles, aged 45 and a lacemaker.&nbsp;
The 1851 census records Richard (aged 63 and a labourer with wife Elizabeth, 62,
but no mention of Charles) and William Rockingham (aged 52 and a labourer with
wife Ann, 46) occupying apparently neighbouring houses in the village.&nbsp;
These two records are numbered 72 and 73 by the census enumerators with no
indication where any of the houses in the village were located.&nbsp; The Grafton record of 1838
does mention that Richard then occupied one of a pair of small cottages.&nbsp;
It is therefore a reasonable assumption to state that William Rockingham lived
at the top of Little Lane.&nbsp; Probably Richard and William were brothers -
they had both separately moved into lodgings elsewhere in the village by 1861.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The house, or chapel, opposite William Rockingham's
house would likely be the barn or the adjoining large house (<a href="../Highstone.htm#stoneacre">'Stoneacre'</a>
in the 20th century) tenanted by Samuel Basford (<a href="../1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_TownEnd_1838.jpg">plots
44 and 45</a> in 1838) who was one of two or three
blacksmiths in the village - retired by the time <a href="../Blacksmiths.htm">photographic
records</a> were made.&nbsp; Samuel was born abt. 1766 and his son William abt.
1796.&nbsp; The Basford family is recorded in the Baptists
notes and so their non-conformist inclinations are evident.&nbsp; From 1841
until at least 1859 there was evidently a Methodist splinter-group which used
Basford's premises.&nbsp; The location was not far from the Elm Tree and would
fit the reference to 'the village centre'.&nbsp; There are no surviving records
of the Methodists which presumably folded up before 1894 (perhaps well before),
that being when the <a href="Parish-01.html">Parish Council</a> was formed and relatively copious notes were
made of village affairs.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There could be a family link between William Basford
and the <font size="3"><a href="basford.htm">Arthur Eaton Basford</a>
