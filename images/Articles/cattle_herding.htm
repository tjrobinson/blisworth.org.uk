<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>An account about cattle herding at Blisworth
Station.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">This following narrative comes to you from a Doctor Leonard Griffith who
together with his wife live in British Columbia.&nbsp; Leonard's parents lived
at Cliff Hill Farm where he was born, the property is now owned by the aged Mr.
George Bonsor.&nbsp; Doctor Griffith's father was a foremost Midlands cattle
dealer, as well as trading extensively in Gloucestershire which was well
serviced with a Railway system connected to Blisworth Station.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On occasions c. 1900, writes Doctor Griffith, cattle were sometimes herded
off the trains in the vicinity of the Hotel frontage in preparation to being
driven to nearby fields or Northampton market. The Hotel had a permanent
resident - a splendid Grey Amazon talking parrot.&nbsp; While the cattle were
being controlled by dogs and the whistle calls of the drovers, striving for
mastery of an agitated bunch of animals, the parrot did its bit by copying the
whistles and shouts.&nbsp; This added much confusion to the scene, for the dogs
just could not differentiate between man and bird.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Doctor Griffith's second story tells of cattle arriving and being started on
their walk to fields adjoining the Northampton Road.&nbsp; The animals after
their journey in cattle trucks badly needed a drink but this was generally not
provide.&nbsp; As they approached Stockwell Bridge over the canal, just a few
hundred yards from the station, they smelt the canal and some of them would leap
over the bridge parapet wall, or were perhaps pushed over by the pressure of
other beasts as they squeezed together between the narrow bridge walls, and
would land in the canal suffering no apparent discomfort.&nbsp; Recovering the
cattle from the towpath would not have been easy.&nbsp; On one hard Winter day
however, the canal was deeply iced over.&nbsp; About 20 animals likewise
smelling the water of the canal went over the parapet wall and broke the thick
ice.&nbsp; Some of them, in attempting to climb out, got into deeper water and
some became trapped under the ice.&nbsp; There they drowned and Doctor Griffith
said that it was weeks before the thaw came and released the corpses that could
be seen under the ice - a sad story indeed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">At this point of the narrative some of you, knowing of the five foot high
walls of the bridge today, may doubt these words but, since those days,
Stockwell Bridge has been rebuilt.&nbsp; The former bridge was very hump-backed,
narrower and possessed much lower walls.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bringing this piece of George Freeston's a little more
up to date are the comments by Peter Griffith.&nbsp; First of all, Leonard's
father was John Griffith and lived at Cliff Hill 19-- to 19--.&nbsp; Leonard's
brother was an Earnest Griffith whom we have come across organising the <a href="../Farming/HShow/horseshow.htm">Blisworth
Horse Shows</a> in the 1950s.&nbsp; Earnest was also a cattle dealer.&nbsp; One
of his four sons recall living at the <a href="../Rails-three.htm#cottages">bungalow
by the station</a> with a triangular plot of land extending to Stockwell Bridge
over the canal.&nbsp; Some cattle kept on that plot manage to learn that neither
bank of the canal was sharply defined in those days (1940s) as pilings had
eroded away and could wade across the canal and graze on the expected greener
grass there.&nbsp; All that Earnest had to do was shake a bucket of nuts and the
cattle would romp and splash back to where they belonged.&nbsp; Earnest also had
groups of cattle delivered to the station and Peter and his brother's were
press-ganged to get on their bikes, at least three of them, to keep ahead of the
rampant herd as it set off up the Gayton Lane beyond the end of Station
Road.&nbsp; Their intended destination was Upper Farm, Tiffield, and this meant
sealing off by bike and boy with waving arms outlets from the road at fields on
the way, at the main Blisworth to Gayton Road, where the cattle were expected to
proceed straight-on over the crossroads, at the Huckerby farm road, at the
pathway which used to be called Pattishall Road and at the bridge over the SMJ
line.&nbsp; Finally the herd had to be turned into the farm drive before to
avert havoc down in Tiffield.&nbsp; Earnest followed redfaced shouting &quot;get
ahead of um&quot; etc.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Bonsor's son-in-law now farms fields part of Cliff Hill
farm.&nbsp; All the buildings have either been taken down or converted into
modern residences.</font></p>
