        <p><font color="#000080">Over the past months I have noticed an absence
        of the once very common house-sparrow (Passer Domesticus).&nbsp; Is it
        because they have been robbed of their cottage-thatch nesting and
        roosting sites?&nbsp; Even where thatch occurs it is now well covered
        with wire netting and ricks and other old farmyard places have gone. Not
        only did we have the common house sparrows, but we had colonies of tree
        sparrows, which usually took over old apple trees adjoining the farm
        buildings.&nbsp; I haven't seen one of their untidy nests for
        years.&nbsp; My bird book says they are more timid than the house
        sparrow.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">From early childhood I seem to remember house
        sparrows around the house and garden. They were waiting each morning for
        my mother to shake the breakfast table cloth outside. I don't think that
        simple task is seen nowadays. Then they followed my father down the
        garden with the pigs' breakfast and the hens' corn. As soon as such
        duties were completed, the sparrows managed to get through the large
        mesh of the wire-netting, but what panic ensued if they were caught
        eating the hens' corn. They simply couldn't get back through the wire
        mesh quickly enough.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The cornfield provided them with
        corn-on-the-straw.&nbsp; Whole flocks would fly out when
        disturbed.&nbsp; The threshing of the corn, sacking it, and moving it
        around left much food about. The modern corn-growing farmer has set up
        his processing buildings with a high degree of hygiene, so that there
        hardly seems to be a grain of wheat laying around.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Again I repeat &quot;Where have all the
        sparrows gone?&quot; Throughout the past centuries sparrows have been
        hounded and hunted, for they certainly ate a lot of corn. Enemy No.1 was
        the householder in whose thatch the sparrow started life. They, likely
        as not, kept ferrets (as we did) and they were mostly fed on sparrows,
        which were shot by a pellet from an air-gun, which was always handy.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">In those days sparrows were looked upon as a
        pest, resulting in a serious attempt to get rid of them.&nbsp;
        Throughout the Grafton estate, as well as all other estates, so named
        &quot;SPARROW CLUBS&quot; were formed.&nbsp; Farmers and the Duke of
        Grafton made donations to the Club.&nbsp; A Secretary/Treasurer was
        appointed for each village, being chosen at the annual Court Leet. The
        result of all this was that every sparrow had a price on its head. After
        dark a group of men and boys went out equipped with a large net, similar
        to a strawberry bed net. This was attached to two long poles, so that
        when erected it looked like a large banner. The attackers approached any
        building covered with ivy. The net was placed against the ivy, and the
        surprised sparrows which were roosting there, were caught in the
        netting, duly extracted and killed. In season, nests were robbed of
        their eggs, and if the young were there, they were likewise collected.
        Young birds were called bolshins or variants of this.&nbsp; The
        resulting haul was then taken to the Sparrow Club Treasurer, who would
        pay out per head of sparrow and egg. The payment would be shared between
        the hunters and was a regular source of beer money.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">From the Blisworth Vestry Meeting (the
        forerunner of Parish Councils) of March 1888, the minutes reveal that
        the price for adult sparrows was fixed at sixpence per dozen if taken
        between Michaelmas Day and Lady Day, but only threepence if taken
        between Lady Day and Michaelmas. Eggs were paid for at threepence a
        dozen and the same for the newly born bolshins. Seemingly, prices varied
        at different times of the year.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">At one time, the Sparrow Club
        Secretary/Treasurer was the Church Sexton and Clockmaker - Mr
        Whitlock.&nbsp; He, like many cottagers, also kept a pig or pigs. I was
        told by his nephew that his uncle's pigs were the thinnest in the
        village, for they were only fed on sparrows and water!&nbsp; In bad
        winters sparrows, and also blackbirds, were netted, skinned, and their
        breast fillets were cut away and made into Sparrow or Blackbird Pie.
        Sparrow Clubs seem to have come to an end after World War One.</font></p>
