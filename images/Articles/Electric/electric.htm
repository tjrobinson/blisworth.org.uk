        <p><img src="map1900.jpg" align="left" height="301" width="293"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        earliest reference to using electricity in the area relates to the
        coal-fired generator installed off Angel Lane running east from Bridge
        Street in Northampton (now Angel
        Street) that served the Court house, Police headquarters and Goal and
        the Guildhall with associated County Offices. It was established
        probably in the mid-Victorian period and would be a DC generator. The
        location is indicated in a 1900 street map (see inset) of the town
        labelling the area &quot;Electric Light Works&quot;. The power
        would have been converted to AC at some point because it is said that
        wires were extended to beyond the town limits (Wootton Hall?) in some
        cases. In the 1920s the Northampton Electric Light and Power Company (NELPC)
        was established at Angel Lane and, also in the 1920s, the first
        significant power station in the County was built at Nunn Mills just
        outside the town limits to the south-east. By 1926 it was supplying
        power to the Wolverton railway works and many firms in the town.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">An important issue in the
        early part of the century was the government’s push towards better
        health and they introduced the <a href="../../Common/housing.htm"> 1924 and 1930 Ministry of Housing
        Acts</a>.
        These acts were aimed to improve conditions in housing, especially the
        more modest housing. Electricity was brought in to Blisworth on
        overhead wires in 1927.&nbsp; This was following a logical sequence:
        from the village of Roade, with its substantial demand by its factories,
        followed by Courtenhall, Collingtree, Milton and Blisworth and on to
        Tiffield and Towcester.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Both the grandfather and
        father of <a href="electric.htm#stan"> Stan Clark&nbsp; (footnote below)</a> worked for the NELPC at Angel Lane and
        the father, Walter, headed the gang that came to Blisworth. He is second
        from the left in the picture above.&nbsp; Apparently life in the village
        was transformed although the basic supply was for one power point and
        five lights. Some people paid to have extra and this facility was
        extended to as late as 1937 by the power company. According to Stan
        Clark, George Freeston remembered that there were several changes in the
        shop (Post Office) next to their High Street garage. One was the heavy
        slump in the sales of paraffin and candles, along with boxes of matches,
        and bundles of spills, all of these being basic commodities, once the
        electricity was installed within the village.</font></p>
        <p><img src="pole.jpg" align="left" height="250" width="472">
        <font color="#000080">There were serious shortages in those years. </font>D<font color="#000080">ue
        to the political problems within Russia, reports Stan Clark, the poles
        needed to carry the electricity wires were in short supply, hence some
        prefabricated concrete poles were used instead. Some of the steel poles
        that once carried the overhead wires for the trams within Northampton</font><font color="#000080">
        with arms that once carried wires for the trams, were used to hang
        street lights on. (not in Blisworth as far as is known) The shortage of poles had another effect</font><font color="#000080">;
        father was paid bonuses if he could get folk to accept the power run
        from house to house instead of using poles as long as the necessary
        brackets could be securely fixed to the walls. Occasionally the residual brackets
        can still be found. Their use was soon banned from the
        installer's code since in some cases the weight of ice on overhead
        cables pulled walls over. The early poles were very tall and were
        finished at the top with a distinctive finial (see inset) but they
        rotted and by the 1970s were either replaced or removed as some wiring
        was placed underground.</font></p>
        <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><font color="#000080">The
        picture above show a typical pole gang - they are wearing standard
        boots. The linesmen who connected the wires from pole to pole did it
        live with the power running through the wires and they always wore stout
        wellington boots as there was no convenient way of switching the power
        off without causing problems with what was already installed. Wealthy
        folk would have the power delivered to a meter within their homes so
        that they could pay quarterly for the amount used. The standard,
        however, was to have a shilling meter with a slot, so as they could pay
        as they used it and rely on an area employee who read those with meters
        and collected coins from others.&nbsp; Certain owners may not have
        bothered with the offered paltry connection in 1927. For example the
        1879 corn mill may have been using its own steam powered electric
        generator.</font></p>
        <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify"><font color="#000080">The
        village took up the use of electricity with some alacrity led, probably,
        by the school which was connected on November 11th, 1927. In November
        three years later the school acquired an electric cooker for the
        kitchen. In January 1931 the staff started offering hot drinks at
        lunchtime for the chidren. By May 1933 the head had acquired a
        projection lantern and gave the first of many educational lantern
        lectures - the first covered the benefits to the British Empire of our
        &quot;ownership&quot; of African territory. No doubt in order to promote
        better communications (we now call networking) the BBC visited the
        school and installed in 1938 a government issue radio set which
        &quot;was carefully checked&quot;. Some time in 1939 another BBC
        employee paid a visit to the school to check radio reception, clearly in
        anticipation of war.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Through the decades,
        especially after the WWII, the NELPC was subsumed by a County
        electricity authority and subsequently merged with the UK wide Central Electricity
        Generating Board (CEGB) which saw the assembly of the electricity grid
        as we now recognise it. In villages such as ours there remained plenty
        of reminders of the overhead distribution and the inter-house wiring on
        the facing walls of adjacent semi-detached houses. The last area to be
        tidied up and placed underground was the wiring in Stoke Road in 2012.</font></p>

        Stanley Joseph Clark - although living in Bugbrooke he is familiar with
        Blisworth because of family relatives in Stoke Road (Gibbs and French)
        and was a friend of George Freeston. He provided the &quot;gang&quot;
        picture and much detail and anecdotes on the 1927 installations.</span></font>
