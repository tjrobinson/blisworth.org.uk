        <p><font size="3" color="#000080"><b>Recently the village school hosted
        a sponsored walk in a bid to raise £3,000 and keep its lollipop lady
        patrolling a busy road in Blisworth. </b>This was because </font>3<font size="3" color="#000080">
        years ago the <b>NCC</b> cut their funding to crossing wardens (ie.
        lollipop ladies) in a bid to save £201,000 within the County. Since
        then Blisworth Community Primary School has relied on outside
        sponsorship to keep Mrs. Dunkley patrolling the High Street, which bears
        the brunt of a lot of traffic leaving the A43 and A508.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000080">But now a three-year agreement with
        Milton Keynes-based company, TMX Recruit, has come to an end so the
        220-pupil school needs to find the money itself. Part of the problem is
        that the crossing site does not normally qualify for a zebra crossing or
        a panda crossing because the road is busy only during the two half-hour
        periods at the beginning and end of school hours when the safety of the
        children is paramount. The village is bisected by the High Street and
        children have homes on either one side or the other or they need to get
        to their parents' pick-up car that might be placed one side or the other
        of the High Street.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000080">In a bid to solve the problem, the
        Parish Council arranged for Orbit Homes to provide by the &quot;106
        Process&quot; a zebra crossing in association with their application to
        build 27 new homes on the side of the High Street that is opposite the
        school. Orbit seem to have <a href="../Orbit/chapel-dev.htm#crisis"> delayed their
        plan</a> to get on and build the houses and Highways,
        who are the arbiters for where the crossing will be placed, have not yet
        finished negotiations with Orbit over the details. There are various
        driveways and areas of unacceptably narrow pavement along the street so
        finding a best location seems fraught. Even so, when the zebra crossing is
        established there is a remaining issue of our expecting the sometimes unaccompanied
        young children to behave with care at the threshold of the zebra. For
        this reason, the Parish Council support a crossing <u> and</u> a patrol warden.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 130; padding-right: 130"><font size="3" color="#000080"><b>Parenthetic
        rant:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Back in 1993/4, when the village
        acquired its multi-facetted <a href="../Calming.htm">traffic-calming</a>, a
        university-based highways consultancy group was brought in to do all
        the designs, which were adopted by <b>NCC</b>  Highways. The crossing selected for the school children and lollipop warden was
        the same one that had been in use for over 25 years, upgraded with a
        strip of distinctively coloured tarmac across the road. It has
        subsequently been used week-in
        and week-out for over 20 years. Now, in 2014, it would
        be a very low-cost exercise to paint the zebra in the same place. <i> But
        no</i>!&nbsp; Currently we seem to have the <b>NCC</b> Highways department
        plumbing for a crossing location a few yards west of this place that
        frankly seems less than the ideal. Surely villagers, parents, motorists know
        what a &quot;not-invented here&quot; factor can do and may grant
        themselves a certain cynicism.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000080">While such questions are sorted out
        there is the task of finding £3000 each year for the crossing warden
        and there is therefore a continuance of village fund-raising with this aim.</font>
        <font color="#000080">The</font> <font size="3" color="#000080">Blisworth
        Parish Council has agreed to provide £1,000 to the school towards
        keeping Clare’s patrol for at least the next three years.</font></p>
