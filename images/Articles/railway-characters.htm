        a descriptive piece by John Whitehead:</b>
        </font></span>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">I have three uncles who worked on the railway. One, a guard at Bletchley worked the 1.20 pm down local through Blisworth one week in six (he also  worked to Oxford, Cambridge - both these lines have long since gone, and  to Watford). Another was a driver at Wellingborough driving the huge  Beyer-Garrett engines (similar to those still seen in South Africa and  elsewhere) on coal trains from Nottinghamshire to Cricklewood power  station, North London, and the third was a ganger in charge of track  maintenance at Kilworth &amp; Welford, a station on the Rugby to Market  Harborough line, part of which I believe now lies under the new A14  road! A Blisworth foreman in the 50's named Whitehead is no immediate  relation but may be connected distantly about five generations ago as a  branch of the Whitehead clan lived at Gayton and several are buried in  the churchyard there.<br>
        <br>
        A few other interesting railway characters - there was <b> 'Dusty' Miller
        </b> at  Blisworth, a madcap signalman but a likeable rogue none the less,
        <b> Jack Eaton</b>, relief signalman at Gayton, Banbury Lane and Heyford to cover  holidays and other absences,
        <b> Bert Reid</b>, signalman at Heyford who used to  say "I'm going down to the Garden Gate tonight"; we thought he meant to  the bottom of his garden until it was realised the name was that of his  local pub, and
        <b> Harry Duff</b>, another relief signalman at Heyford and  Weedon who claimed to see little green men on his night shift. This of  course was the time of the Eagle comic,
        ie. of Dan Dare and the Mekon so  "Duffy's little men" became a standing joke.
        <b> <a href="../Rails-three.htm#almond"> Jack Almond</a></b> I sadly never  met although his predecessor Big <b> Bill Kimbell</b> I did
        know - he was nicknamed after Big Bill Campbell. His duties  included periodic checks on the Gayton and Banbury Lane boxes and he  used to cycle along the line when visiting. Signalmen would tip each  other the wink when he was about and when he was seen approaching  Banbury Lane from Gayton I had to temporarily leave the box as I  shouldn't have been there in the first place.<br>
        <br>
        <b>
        Teddy Morris</b> was also  subjected to jokes, such was rural humour at the time. It was claimed  that he weighed around 19 stone, his wife weighed
        around 22 stone and  when they were in bed together it was necessary to put planks beneath  the bed, piled on bricks each side, to prevent the bed from sagging (no  spring mattresses in those days). We'll probably never know if this was  true now and I'm not sure if it's politically correct to mention it!&nbsp;
        He lived at 35 Stoke Road,  Blisworth and worked the Banbury Lane box.
        Despite being so portly he rode a 1942 Excelsior 98cc
        auto-cycle, proudly boasting that it would  take him up the hill from Banbury Lane towards Gayton
        &quot;without pedalling&quot;.

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Next, a piece
        based on a photograph that has been placed on the website front page for
        months - &quot;Railway
        Gang&quot;.</b>&nbsp; I like the way these guys make a friendly
        huddle.&nbsp; They are all pea-way (ie. &quot;Permanent Way&quot;)
        staff, maintaining the rail lines over defined sectors.&nbsp; The photo
        was taken in the late 1950s.&nbsp; The identities were worked out by
        Andy Newbery who, as a <a href="../Festival/2011/account.htm#andy">railways
        buff</a>, spent quite a bit of time visiting most of the oldies
        in Blisworth:&nbsp; From left to right the names are <b>Harry Goodridge</b>
        from Shutlanger, Connie Lane's uncle, then there is <b>Arthur Busby</b>
        nearly hidden behind Harry.&nbsp; With his bicycle clips on, ready to ride home,
        is <b><a href="../people-three.htm#g. clarke">George Clarke</a></b>, signals engineer who lived to an old age at Elm
        Tree Cottage.&nbsp; There are photos of him elsewhere and recently his
        daughter Susan has published a book about their ancestors.&nbsp; The
        young man behind George is not known but some people asked think he was
        from the Roade sector.&nbsp; Then there is <b>Ted Monk</b>, with the
        dark cap.&nbsp; He is also pictured as a <a href="../schools.htm#monk"> 10 year old pupil</a> at Blisworth
        school in 1925.&nbsp; The guy with receding hair is <b>Arthur Yates</b>
        and the final guy on the right is unknown.&nbsp; As he is wearing a neat
        jacket and maybe some ID, he could be from the Roade ticket office.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="gang-one.jpg" width="550" height="449"><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Finally,
        another picture of a group of happy railway men.</b>&nbsp; This was also
        researched by Andy Newbery for the special reason his dad is in the
        picture.&nbsp; This gathering was celebrating Ted's birthday with a
        clock, some flowers and a photo for posterity.&nbsp; The hut in the
        background is the Permanent Way Hut, a tea-makers shelter about 100
        yards east along the main line tracks from Milton Crossing.&nbsp; The Ted was Ted
        Eyre, third from the left, bolt upright in appreciation; we think he was
        Ruby Whitlock's father.&nbsp; From left to right there was <b>Jack White</b>
        and an unknown guy in the dark trilby, then <b>Ted Eyre</b> and <b>Ted
        Monk</b> behind him.&nbsp; It's a few years on from the photo above,
        perhaps 1960, and Ted Monk has a new cap!&nbsp; He seemed to like the
        back row.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Michael Yates</b> was able to recognise himself
        next, wearing the light overcoat at 22 years of age.&nbsp; Apparently ,
        being the youngster on the gang he had to organise the flowers and the
        clock.&nbsp; The Yates in the photo above is probably a cousin.&nbsp;
        The next guy, holding a spade, is <b>Peter Newbery</b>, Andy's
        father.&nbsp; The last fellow on the right is a <b>Mr. Chambers</b> and
        it is thought that he was from the Roade sector.</font>
