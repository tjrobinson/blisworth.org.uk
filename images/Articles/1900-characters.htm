born before 1900.<br>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>Mr Arthur Norman</b> was born
at Blisworth before 1899.&nbsp; I went into Northampton to talk to him and found him and his wife living in the Betheny<sup> </sup>Homestead.&nbsp;
Sadly although he looked well his memory was failing, every minute he asked me
who I was, and when I said George Freeston he said.. &quot;Ah, George Freeston
from Blisworth&quot; However he told me that he was born in 1897 in one of the
cottages behind the former Sun Moon and Stars. His father was the blacksmith for
the Westley Mill and the Westley farm, ie. <a href="../Farms.htm#glebe"> Glebe Farm</a> on the Towcester Road.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">They worked 26 Shire horses either on the land or with the<i> </i>corn
waggons which ran 4 horses per team per waggon. Horses were stabled at the
Grafton House stables, where lived Mr John Westley, and some came up to Crieff
House in the Stoke Road, where lived Mr Alfred Westley.&nbsp; Arthur's father, F
W Norman was
captain of the St Johns Ambulance (see below - F W Norman seated on the left,
stretcher before them) which had a very active squad in the village.
The Mr Norman whom I saw, first worked on the farm as a plough boy leading the
horses up and down the field all day. He soon packed that in, he told me, and next
he worked for Oliver Young the village grocer. He used<i> </i>to go on the
grocery rounds with &quot;Coddy&quot; <a href="../Shop.htm#coddy"> Harry Plowman</a> with the horse and delivery
waggon. This meant a long day of visiting neighbouring villages such as Stoke
Bruerne, Shutlanger, Alderton, Ashton, Hartwell and Courteenhall. He was one of
the party of boys who went to Victoria House on Sunday evenings where <a href="../chapelgroups.htm#hatch"> Miss Hatch</a>
taught the boys to sing etc. Since Mr Norman's father was the Westley
Blacksmith, his smithy was in the Mill yard over the canal and this enabled the
family to shout across the canal to Mr Norman senior when dinner was ready. In
winter, the children were delighted to run over on the ice to see their father
shoeing the horses. I had many questions to put to Mr Norman but I found that I
had left it all too late . . .</font></p>

live and have their memories for ever . . .</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080"><b>Mr <a href="../Farms.htm#gulliver"> Fred Gulliver</a> was born</b> at Greatwoth 93 years ago (this written in Feb
1975). A long time ago. He has lived at Blisworth for the past 50 years, and has
farmed Glebe Farm on the Towcester Road Hill which lately belongs to the steel
company.&nbsp; In his boyhood he assisted his father when living at Foxley Lodge
with horse-and-cart work in the building of the Culworth section of the Great
Central Railway. He lost his wife some years ago and since then he has
&quot;been looked after&quot; by his eldest unmarried daughter Nancy who has
been his &quot;right hand man&quot;. Until a few years ago he also employed one
labourer - a great countryman who was content with the simple life. He also
thought much of his cattle and their feeding took priority over his own meal
times and he was proud of his home produced beasts.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On his 80th birthday I took him to Bournmouth to see the sea for the first
time of his life. A man of few words, he looked at everything in the fields as
we went down. I stopped the car at the edge<i> </i>of the cliffs at Bournmouth
and said &quot;well, there's the sea then&quot; He looked long in silence at the
illusion of the sea rising up to the horizon and then exclaimed &quot; My guy,
its gooing up hill&quot;. When he got home his daughter Nancy said &quot;well
father, what did you think of it all&quot; and his plain answer was &quot;We saw
some fine horses and some lovely green fields&quot; but no mention was made of
the sea.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Nancy his daughter intends to farm until September. Her married sister Mrs
George Clarke lives with her husband at Elm Tree House which is a fine early
17th century house in the Courteenhall Road and opposite to the school. This
house was, for long time, the home of members of the Young family including
Frank Young late Parish Clerk. It was bequeathed to Miss Margaret Burbidge who
sold it to Mr G Clarke for around £600 some 15 years ago. Some conversions were
carried out by Bob Wood, a local builder, but many very fine features were
destroyed including a great fireplace beam. Elsewhere, when the wall plaster was
stripped off <a href="../Misc-just.htm#psalm"> a fine panel of wall painting</a> was revealed.&nbsp;
I managed to
influence Mr Clarke to<sub> </sub>preserve this painting.</font></p>
