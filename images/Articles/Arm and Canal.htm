        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        area around the station and the Arm felt as if it were slightly apart
        from the main part of the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The canal in the late forties and early fifties still had several
        old-style boats through every day, but the number soon declined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I am glad I had a chance to see boats with the <a href="../Miscellaneous/decorations.htm"> “roses and
        castles” decorations</a> before they disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        Navigation Inn was still in business into the early fifties and was
        busy, it seemed to me, but obviously not busy enough to be viable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There was a gap between the end of traditional boat traffic and
        the real take-off of recreational boating, and I suppose this is what
        spelt the end of the pub.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        was bought and substantially added to and improved as a private house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        Baillions lived in the large house at the far end of the Arm, and the
        long, low white house was used by British Waterways’ employees being
        adjacent to the 'waterways depot'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There was a farm opposite – whether this was BW property I do
        not know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nearer the
        village end lived the Fullers, he worked for BW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>My older sister was friendly with their daughter, Beryl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">I
        spent endless hours as a child wandering the canal towpaths – they
        were simply considered part of the footpath system then, a useful quick
        way from A to B.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
        very good for watching wildlife, lots of water voles and various birds
        and wild flowers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of
        the towpaths were in poor repair in parts and you had to watch your
        footing, especially in wet weather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They were repaired in later years and the canal banks were
        reinforced, often with concrete slabs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This made the paths safer but destroyed much of the water voles
        habitat. Such matters were not considered in those days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">We
        were always warned never to go into the canal water as it was very
        polluted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The properties at
        the Arm discharged raw sewage into it in those days!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">In
        very cold winters the canal would freeze over and we could walk and
        slide on it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I remember
        seeing BW officials coming to test the depth of the ice by chiselling a
        hole through and measuring with a rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
