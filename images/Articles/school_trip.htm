        <p><font size="3" color="#000080">A school trip - the idea of
        re-enacting something that happened a century ago is rather appealing,
        in a romantic sort of way. There is always the possibility that a ghost
        or two might appear to add a bit of Victorian spirit, or some
        deep-buried secret reveal itself after decades of obscurity. So it was
        with the Northamptonshire Natural History Society's visit <a href="../Early&#32;Industry/lime-railway.htm"> to Blisworth
        stone quarry</a> this month. It was planned as part of their current
        centenary celebrations, since this was the venue of the first trip made
        by the newly formed Geological Section on August 10, 1876 - being a
        visit recorded in annals as having a special interest on account of the
        fascinating variety of fossils found embedded in the limestone, as
        indicated below.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000080">A report in the Natural History
        Society Journal of that year tells of the &quot;fourteen enthusiastic
        geologists&quot; who set out on that trip one Thursday afternoon. Their
        chief finds that day were a set of shark's teeth and the broken tooth of
        some species of lizard. At that time, of course, the quarry had been
        worked for some years. Situated in the south-east corner of the parish,
        it was opened in 1815-1821 and continued until about 1912. A stone-wagon
        railway connected the quarry to the canal and in so doing crossed the
        road between Blisworth and Stoke Bruerne. But for this month's trip, the
        quarry presented a very different picture. It is overgrown with trees
        and bushes and appears suddenly when you come upon it after tramping
        across fields of stubble. But for generations of geologists since 1876
        it has proved a veritable gold mine, and it inspired many of the local
        enthusiasts from Campion School to set to work with hammers immediately.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000080">The original idea for the centenary
        jaunt came from the society's section president, Mr. Gordon Osborne, who
        has been associated with the society over the past 40 years. &quot;It
        struck me as rather a nice idea, and it seemed to catch on,&quot; he
        said. But, sensibly, Mr. Osborne left the organisation to local
        historian Mr. George Freeston, a Blisworth-born man, who proved to be a
        fascinating guide. The visit was conducted in a fleet of cars.&nbsp;
        After a thorough exploration of the quarry, the group went on to
        Blisworth Stone Works.&nbsp; Now housing two families, the stone works
        house was once linked to the quarry by the same railway. It is a
        splendid monument to a time of thriving industry and plentiful materials
        for building.&nbsp; In the photo is Mr. Osborne making a point with
        George Freeston, pictured on the right, ably assisting.&nbsp; In the
        party from the school, there was at least one, Gary King, who went on to a
        flourishing career in geology and resources for an oil company - he still has the
        shark's teeth in a sweets tin.&nbsp; Given time he might have gone on to
        discover traces of oil beneath Blisworth.&nbsp; In his itinerary sheet
        Mr. Freeston promised to lay on a full moon &quot;to help the homeward
        journeys&quot;. And, sure enough, there it was, big and golden, shining
        bright in the dark sky. Which all goes to show what a little
        organisation will do!</font></td>
