      amongst villagers, even many who were not allotment holders, that

      can see they were quite right; in October 1954 there was a district

      council</a><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      houses to the village so it must have been common knowledge within district

      &quot;scheduled&quot; for expansion <b>yet the vision escaped them</b>

      increase in the parish council precept.&nbsp; Ron French mentioned there

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      was right; this was an era in which the parish council did not properly

      strike the village later</a>, not in terms of council houses but through speculative development.&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      allotments in the village
      since then has been healthy up to times in which the economics for domestic leisure<br>

      had changed
      dramatically.&nbsp; In future, the use community land is put to will
