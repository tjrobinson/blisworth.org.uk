<p align="center" style="padding-top: 44"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>Selected Entries from School Log Book
1922 - 1958</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p>Although each log book has about 500 pages (~30 pages per year), the large
majority of entries are routine and record attendance, the weather as it
impinges on the lessons and visits to the school, etc.&nbsp; Medical matters
including epidemics have been extracted to
form a separate article to be made available on this website when
completed.&nbsp; The records on the weather may also be separately extracted -
except for 1947 they are not included here.&nbsp; The span of these entries
includes the latter 6 years of Mr. Green's tenure as Head Teacher followed by a
few years with Mr. Bailey and 24 years with Mr. Cole.</p>
<p>This period sees the coming of sewers, electricity, gas, BBC radio (the
pre-war information-highway for schools), cinematography and piped water to the
school.&nbsp; Noticeable also is a gradual change in language over the period.</p>
