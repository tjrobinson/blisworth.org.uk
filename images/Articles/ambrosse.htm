 On April 19th, 1797, the Rev. John Ambrose, BA, was
inducted at Blisworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His Patron
was George Finch-Hatton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the
next eight years the new Rector saw the completion of the canal and Blisworth
tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He also met, through
marriages, births and deaths, many of the new families whose men folk had come
to work on the canal construction at Blisworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His record of keeping the registers is indicated by the inset photograph
taken from the marriage register for the year 1800.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Rev. John Ambrose occupied the rectory, which is now demolished <a href="ambrosse.htm#1">[1]</a>,
next to the Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
predecessor, Nathanial Trotter, had died at Blisworth on 15th February 1797, so
there had not been a long period of interregnum.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">It was customary for the Officiating Rector to sign the
Registers whenever the Archdeacon inspected them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At the March 1807 visitation, John Ambrose, Rector, duly
signs, underlining his name with a delightful flourish of penmanship.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>But this signature was not to appear again until the
year 1836.</b><o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 1810 the Archdeacon again inspected the registers but
this time the entries are signed by the Curate, Joseph Sturges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There must have been a dispute over this signing, for the Curate's name
is crossed out and above it is written the name &quot;Maria Ambrose<a href="ambrosse.htm#2">[2]</a>&quot;, who
we must assume was the Rector's wife and who was signing for her husband - but
where was he?<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The next visitation, in 1812, was also signed by J. Sturges,
as the Officiating Minister; this time there is no mention of either the Rector
or his wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon afterwards the
Rev. J. Sturges departs from Blisworth and his post is taken by another curate;
the Rev, Wm. Butlin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is now
obvious that the Rector had absented himself from the village, for at the 1811
assessment of the Rev. Ambrose's rates for £5, 12. 3d, the cash was not
forthcoming and neither was he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also,
at this same time, a sequestrator is appointed to handle the affairs of the
Church in the Rector's absence.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In searching through the Registers, the Rev, Ambrose's
signature disappears from the years 1807 - 1836, entries being signed mainly by
the faithful Curate, the Rev, Dm. Butlin.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>By way of explaining the absence . . .</b><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At the beginning or the 19th Century, young Lord Althorp was
a great sportsman, a Patron of Boxing and a gambler.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>His companions not only included the great prize fighters and
pugilists of the day, but also his associates included the Prince Regent, Lord
Byron and “Parson Ambrose, Rector of Blisworth” being a man well known in
sporting circles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of our
Rector's connections with such a mixed company, he was soon enveloped in debts
through his gambling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was said
that he disgraced a profession that he might have adorned, for he was clever and
had a remarkably fine delivery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the death of the great actor, Charles Macklin, the Rev. Ambrose was left the
exceedingly generous sum of £50 to preach the Actor's Funeral Sermon. Around
the year 1808, Lord Althorp reports that Parson Ambrose of Blisworth is obliged
to flee the country from his Creditors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
law caught up with him, in France apparently - he was filed for bankruptcy in 1814 as indicated by the
following court entries.<o:p></o:p>
