        <h1 align="center" style="padding-left: 110; padding-right: 110"><font color="#000080" size="3">On
        April the 4th 2010, the landlord had vacated the premises leaving the
        pub closed and, incidently, it has been said &quot;depleted of certain leisure furniture&quot;.&nbsp;
        The closure caused considerable worry in the village until, rumour upon rumour,
        some new publicans reopened on June 5th 2010 to a veritable crowd of
        villagers curious to find out what the &quot;new look&quot; is
        like.&nbsp; New carpets and a good spring clean - that's great!&nbsp; We
        wish the new business all the success.</font></h1>

        account below was posted just about a year ago when the previous tenants
        were in considerable difficulties.&nbsp; It is left in place for the
        record!</font></b></o:p>
        </font></h1>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Royal Oak Pub has not
        enjoyed particularly good business for over five years, in fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The landlady has constantly to come up with
        ways to encourage villagers to use the pub.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If her business fails then the owners of the Pub will have a
        choice between two options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
        is to find another tenant landlord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The other is to close and de-license the Pub and sell the entire
        plot to a property developer.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The owners in fact have a current track record of selling
        hundreds of pubs across the country in recent months and the spectre of
        the loss of our pub in the village might not be far away.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Property development could
        mean the following; (i) conversion of the Pub into a private dwelling
        house after 300 years, (ii) the building of new houses along the High
        Street thus removing the car park and (iii) the building of more new houses
        in the garden area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Think
        about this – villagers doing their shopping and mothers delivering
        their children to the school have used that car park, which is an
        undoubted asset in the village centre – village groups have used the
        garden area for fundraising activities, it being another asset offering
        a pleasant open space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        both could be lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
        are some other services that the Pub offers to the
        village, eg. a function room for weddings, bands etc. and a pensioner's lunch each week
        and all these would be lost.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This is where the slogan
        “use it or loose it” applies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        the 1800 population of the parish there are some 1000 adults within
        walking distance of the Pub.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
        if a small portion of that number came along for a drink and maybe a
        snack, each week, then the business would survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>You don’t have to be drinker to enjoy the Pub and meet your
        friends there – talk to the landlady (when she is back from holiday!) about your preferences regarding
        food and types of music – remember, be patient; a pub always turns
        into what locals prefer.<o:p>
