      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A
      passerby reported to British Waterways that a hole had
        appeared in the middle of a grassy triangle of Waterways land adjacent
        to Candle Bridge, quite near to the canal-side weir.&nbsp; It was
        immediately fenced off.&nbsp; In the following few days the hole
        enlarged itself and presented the inset view on 17th April.&nbsp; Water
        was seen trickling through at a depth of about 8 feet below the turf but
        the hole appeared to be much deeper than that.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        substantial loss of soil, evidenced by the surface collapse, suggests a
        water path that would have generated a scouring action for quite a time.&nbsp; The
        obvious suggestion was that one of the culverts at a depth of 16 to 18
        feet which collect water from the weir and the land-gate may well have collapsed allowing a path for washed soil to go
        into the nearby lake and onwards down to Swan Valley.&nbsp; The trickle
        at a much shallower depth, however, indicated that the land-gate or
        perhaps its brick box may be damaged too.&nbsp; By 24th April it was obvious
        to the BW staff that the wooden paddle in the land-gate had rotted to such an extent that it
        was serving little purpose and, anyway, to provide effective shut-off in
        times of drought it had been more or less completely filled with ash
        silt to seal it.&nbsp; In enquiries it was not possible to ascertain the origin
        of the trickle, being probably a lesser concern anyway.&nbsp; After all,
        this account is <i>not</i>
        supposed to serve as an engineering report.</span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">An
        excavator was used to removed more soil so revealing an old collapsed dry culvert, seen above to the
        left, that was no doubt used to provide in the old days (before the weir was
        built in 1958) a means of flooding in emergencies the adjacent field called
        Pond Bank.&nbsp; The old culvert has been sealed off and is shown in
        light blue in the mock-up schematic on the right.&nbsp; The pale yellow
        circle represents the main hole as seen on 25th April and the smaller
        yellow circle indicates the very deep (12 feet and beyond) hole that is
        evident by the base of the ladder.&nbsp; Note there is an electric cable
        running down into this 'abyss' - someone had probably made an
        inspection.&nbsp; The idea of a breached culvert at roughly where there is a red
        cross seemed very plausible.&nbsp; The culverts, at a depth of about 18
        feet, are shown orange in the schematic.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark blue line near all this
        excavation, both natural and human combined, is the high pressure natural gas conduit,
        12 inches diameter, which steeply banks downwards to pass under
        the canal.&nbsp; At that stage it was not thought to be involved in this
        business.&nbsp; The fine black line passing close to the land-gate is a
        fibre-optic communications line running from London to Birmingham
        carrying a vast number of data channels.&nbsp; Luckily it had been only partially uncovered, in its
        plastic green pipe, at the side of the excavation, far enough out of
        harm's way.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;Once the minor leakage had been sorted out the next phase was for a specialist sub-contractor to excavate a massive hole in order to gain safe access to
        the suspected damaged culvert.&nbsp; This was to take several days and,
        in the interests of safety, the hole was roughly backfilled with earth
        whilst the contractors were awaited.</font>
