        was connected to the Grand Union Canal located a short distance

        1796.&nbsp; Napoleonic wars in Europe encouraged the English government
        to set up a military supply depot well away from the coast and any risk
        of capture as it was well known that Napoleon had made plans for the
        invasion of England.&nbsp; In 1803, an Act of Parliament secured 53 acres of
        land but later the estate was extended to 150 acres.</o:p></o:p>

        branch canal entered the Depot under a portcullis at its eastern
        end.&nbsp; The portcullis was set in a building known as the East Lodge
        integrated in a high brick perimeter wall. It can still be seen.&nbsp; At the west end there is a similar
        lodge and the canal originally<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>extended
        beyond it to serve specialised buildings designed to store gunpowder
        that was delivered by canal boat. These &quot;magazine&quot; storage
        buildings, each separated from the other by a building filled with
        earth, can still be seen from within the trading estate
        off the Daventry Road (A 45) that occupies the area once used by the
        barracks.<o:p>

        original design for the Depot was based on storehouses set out at right
        angles to the branch canal.&nbsp; This was abandoned as it was seen as a
        disadvantage to be constrained to fill a storehouse from the end like a
        sack!&nbsp;&nbsp; The buildings were built chiefly of red bricks that
        were made nearby.&nbsp; The sill bands of stone were considered
        non-essential but were included to enhance the appearance of the
        buildings.</span></font></span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font size="3" color="#000080">

        as the Depot, the barracks were arranged about a
        Barrack Square. Some buildings had stables on the ground floor since the
        original purpose was to accommodate an artillery division that used guns
        hauled by horse.&nbsp; Later in 1922, the barracks became the Army School of Equitation, and an extensive indoor
        riding school and further stables were constructed. After being disused
        for many years they were demolished during the winter of 1955-6.<o:p>

        storehouses are now owned privately and are Grade II* listed.&nbsp; Many
