        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><b>Introduction
        - brief history&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        village had &quot;slept for centuries&quot;, with perhaps the exception
        of being very much awake in the years during and immediately after
        Cromwell's Commonwealth years. There was a rude awakening that
        arose out of the industrial revolution. The initial signs were perhaps
        the team of surveyors in 1792 wandering over the &quot;north
        field&quot;, a tract of land that was still not enclosed, and spending
        much time on Blisworth Hill all the way over towards Stoke Bruerne. The
        surveyors must have told villagers of an intended waterway to be dug through the parish and
        a fantastic-sounding tunnel to be dug through the hill in a bid to make
        a waterway joining Birmingham with the Thames in London.
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Some
        senior villagers would be aware of the subsequent developments which
        unfolded and maybe they were not surprised when the deep and wide trench
        was being dug in 1795 and 1796 and the arrival of the extended trench at the little bridge that
        carried
        the road to Towcester over a stream which, each winter, filled the
        water-mill pond. That mill-pond was orphaned from its water which, along
        with other streams running off the hillside, was used to gradually fill
        the trench.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">What
        then happened was that the space, near the bridge, on both sides of the trench was
        levelled and cut back and dressed with ground limestone or cinders to
        form makeshift wharves. The
        trench was christened &quot;The Grand Junction Canal&quot; as it brought
        the first horse drawn barges from Birmingham. There would be
        consignments of coal, bricks and timber arriving to be stacked on the
        new wharves where there would also be goods from the midlands that could
        be shipped back to Birmingham - obviously shoes and boots would be
        prominently represented as would a certain amount of building stone.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        road from Northampton to Towcester was upgraded to a turnpike in 1796
        and this simply meant that a group of managers purchased materials and
        labourer's time to maintain the road in a fit condition for the
        extra traffic. The funding for this was generated at toll gates which
        sprang up every mile or so, much to the distress of all the farmers of
        the area.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        other half of the canal route was being established, also during the
        1793 - 1796 period, and work was begun on the tunnel through the hill.
        Another toll gate road was established over the hill in 1796. This road was
        extremely stressed in providing the continuity of canal-borne goods from
        Blisworth to Stoke Bruerne so completing, after a fashion, the
        connection between Birmingham and London. So stressed, in fact, that a <a href="../../TheHillRailway.htm">
        horse-railway</a> was set up in 1800 by a Derby engineer (Mr. Outram) to
        take some of the shipping load away from the road over the hill. This
        rail line was established with its terminus at the western wharf in
        Blisworth, running on the west side of the canal, over the hill which
        was to contain the tunnel, and running down to the eastern side of the
        canal at Stoke Bruerne and further south to its other terminus beyond
        the place where locks were to be built in the centre of Stoke Bruerne.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        hill railway was built after a desperate stall in progress over the
        building of the tunnel during which some consultants were brought in the
        advise. The chief problems were that the line of the first tunnel
        attempt was slightly cranked and the digging work on it had been destroyed
        at one end and severely hampered at the other by water springing out of
        the hill. <a href="../../Tunnel&#32;Story/Tunnel-Story.htm"> A new line</a> was surveyed and work began on it in 1801 or 1802
        once the excavation that was started into the hillside was continued
        another 300 yards, &quot;by digging through the ruins of the first
        attempt&quot;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Once
        the tunnel was completed in 1805 the hill railway was closed. The
        pressure on <a href="../../West&#32;Bridge/west-end.htm"> the wharves at Blisworth</a> would be lessened&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Celebration, June 6th
        2015 - our Red Wheel Day</b></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">At
      ten o'clock members of the village and some officials from council and
      Transport Trust assemblied at the towpath near Mill Bridge. Jan
      Andrews of our Canal Partnership, James Clifton of the Canal and River
      Trust, Stuart Wilkinson of the <a href="http://www.transportheritage.com"> Transport Trust</a> gave short speeches to
      explain the need for a Red Wheel plaque commemorating the period 1795 -
      1850 through which the village held the status of one of the most
      important inland trans-shipment ports in the British Isles. Jan Andrews
      then unveiled the plaque watched by Stuart Wilkinson to her left.</span></font></p>

      <p><img src="tm-mic.jpg" align="left" width="220" height="308">
      <font color="#000080">The rest of the day was spent first taking a boat
      trip to the tunnel mouth and the junction of the Northampton Arm, which by
      1817 provided the inclusion of Northampton into the canal system and a means of
      connecting with the River Nene. This arm of water was briefly preceded by
      a horse railway referred to in a Grafton map as a &quot;Rail Road&quot; (ie.
      the Americans alone did not invent this term!). There followed a continued celebration at
      the Chapel Tea Room with refreshments and the cutting of a celebratory
      cake baked by Beryl Payler. There were also organised trips to the tunnel
      hut to view the <a href="../../CanalScape/stable.htm"> mural created there
      October 2013</a>. The Mikron Theatre group
      gave a presentation based upon the Centenary of the formation of the
      Women's Institute in the Old Rectory garden in the evening which was
      attended by an estimated 400 people.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000080">On the boat trip, organised so that the &quot;dignitaries&quot;
      were on &quot;Indian Chief&quot; and all the rest were on
    &quot;Crusader&quot;,
      there were heritage commentaries given respectively by yours truly and
      Hilary Spurrier from the <b>BHS</b>. Whilst I am sure we agreed on the facts, I
    do suspect that my talk was insufficiently interesting, since I am aware of
    omitting 3 or 4 details and of the fact that there is virtually no
    archaeology from our canal building era that remains for us to point at,
    other than proof of an aborted tunnel line that is mainly evident on the
    south side of BlisworthHill.</font></p>
    <p><img src="polline.jpg" align="left" width="482" height="173">
    <font color="#000080">The boat trip was curtailed at Blisworth Arm because of a fuel leak discovered during the
    early hours and the Northamptonshire Police have described it as the result of a “criminal act”.
    There was a considerable danger of explosion or fire arising from the leak.
    An announcement was made on the lines of -“We are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen anything suspicious in that area
    during the early hours of today to contact us as soon as possible on 101 or Crimestoppers
    Anonymous”. It would appear that some rather unwise thieves were
    &quot;collecting&quot; scrap iron but felt they couldn't brave the probable
    consequences of completing the task.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Details of the history and the background to the
      plaque, this one being the 75th that has been installed in the British
      Isles, may be found in due course on the Transport Trust website.</font></p>
