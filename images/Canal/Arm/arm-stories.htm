      some explanatory notes:&nbsp;</b>  <i> Mr. Henshaw says at one point that he
      was 5 or 6 when Thomas Millner came to the Arm - it seems he lived
      there.&nbsp; As that was in 1895, we therefore know that Henshaw was born
      1889 or 1890.&nbsp; Inspection of the 1901 census reveals that a Henshaw
      family lived at the Arm in &quot;Savages Cottages&quot;, these being the
      houses opposite Millner's maintenance yard, and lists two daughters and
      many boys; William born 1887, Thomas 1890, James 1892, Frank 1896, Albert
      1899 and Harry, babe in arms 1901.&nbsp; Mr. Henshaw was therefore
      &quot;Thomas&quot; (with a slimmer possibility that it was William).&nbsp;
      The talking ranged over a number of topics, jumping about, and because of the noise at the
      bar, some are undecipherable.&nbsp; At one point 'a mate' starts up to
      talk about loading at the sand-landing.&nbsp; Henshaw and his mate both
      seem to be talking about a
      time 1900 - 1910.&nbsp; I have
      transcribed the easiest bits and tried to stick to the order the subjects
      were raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      . . . someone made a hole in the ice, for a bucket, and I was sliding and I fell in.&nbsp; Got a new suit
      on, with brass buttons and I couldn't go home so I went to the wagon barn
      where there was some hay.&nbsp; Got cold and stiff, my sister found me
      whimpering and took me home. [<i>sister Isabella was four years older</i>]</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">
      I remember there were two tollmen, one worked at night, the boss one was a
      Mr Dawson who was in the Toll House. [<i>this is in accord with the 1901
      census</i>].&nbsp; Their job was to gauge the weight of goods on the boats and
      charge a toll accordingly.&nbsp; They used a rod down the side of the
      barge - with a vernier on the
      end, it worked like a hydrometer for car batteries.&nbsp; No, they didn't
      do it from the staging because they got onto the boat and measured how
      high it was in the water at the four corners, take a average.&nbsp; This
      was by the bridge - yes, the <a href="Arm-general.htm#bridge"> staging by the bridge just by the toll
      house</a>.
      [<i>someone was quizzing him</i>]&nbsp; They worked out the tonnage on board from
      the vernier that was set just on the rail with the rod just touching the
      water.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>Mate:</b>&nbsp;
      . . . I was quick as I could, jumping from one gate to another in the
      dark, doing all the paddles, and when I got back the driver said
      &quot;where have you been&quot;.&nbsp; Course we had to work at night, sometimes starting at 4 in the morning to
      get a load done by the petrol depot (<i>see below</i>).</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b><a name="loft"></a>Henshaw:&nbsp;
      </b>I remember Dawson was the tollman and the pub was run by Cross.&nbsp; </span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">Crosses were the
      landlords, in the days when there was much singing
        and fighting spilling outside on the grass. The pub had a rough stable
      next door, just a slate roof, and boaters in very cold weather would
        sleep with their horses if they had paid for a stable, just slates over
        all of them.&nbsp; It were warmer than on the boat.&nbsp; Normally they
      would sleep above the horses on a deck that I remember had got blackened
      from candles that get knocked over but on some cold nights they would
      sleep by the horse - get up in the morning smelling like a broom!&nbsp;
      Yes, it was a risk with the candles and luckily there were no fire at the
      stable.&nbsp; Some bargees were really rough and you couldn't follow their
      talk sometimes, they might as well be speaking French or German.&nbsp;
      They could neither
        read nor write, and would ask us to write for them - even love letters,
      talk about edification!&nbsp; I'd say, &quot;Oh, how do you spell that?&quot; He'd say, &quot;What do you mean
        - get it down for me&quot;.&nbsp; They couldn't understand that&nbsp;you
      had to spell before you could write it down.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">[<i><b>Notes
      elsewhere by GF:</b></i>&nbsp; <i>Thomas Henshaw was one of many children,
      c1895.&nbsp; They sometimes slept with their blind Uncle Jim on this deck
      (referred to as a loft by the owners in 1983) with cracked slates overhead
      through which snow would descend and on better nights you could see the
      stars.&nbsp; A horse below with a cough meant they wouldn't sleep, and
      each time one urinated the smell wafted up to greet them.&nbsp; The good
      news was that <a href="../../people-four.htm#henshaw"> Jim was superb on the accordion</a> - perhaps the horses were
      quietened by that too</i>]</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b><a name="savage"></a>Mate
        (then taken over by H.):</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        I
        loaded sand at the wharf, down Milton Beach, by the petrol depot, yes - at
        sandlanding, [<i>bridge number 3 is
        called 'sandlanding bridge' and it seems somewhere near there was called
        Milton Beach - suggesting sand and water's edge</i>].&nbsp; I was chucking it on by shovel till the boat
        grounded then pushing the boat further out and loading more sand by
        wheel-barrow over a plank, two of us.&nbsp; No not Asplin, this was for
        Savage [<i>ie. pre-1911</i>].&nbsp; The load was supposed to be 30 ton and
        it was gauged at top lock, it had to be 30 ton!&nbsp; We would go down 17
        locks and unload at the Corporation Wharf, at Watney's wharf if you
        like, wheeled it all off, and then we brought the boat back up through
        17 locks and tie up. Guess what I got for that . . . I would get 6 bob, that was
        it, 7 if it
        were bricks instead.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b><a name="asplin"></a>Mate:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After Savages I worked for the ironstone until it was packed up in
        1919.&nbsp; Then I worked for Asplin to take his brickworks down . . .
        and move it across the canal, set up anew [<i>this was in the period
      1919 - 1921, according to some of Millner's letters</i>]</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Henshaw:</b>&nbsp;
      When did legging stop? . . . oh about 80 years ago.&nbsp; I met the last
      tug-man that was at Blisworth not long ago.&nbsp; His name was Leah, still
      alive down Far Cotton.&nbsp; He went to visit Stoke (Bruerne) and came away in
      disgust - he said it were a show-place now, not a work-place.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Immediately
      next to the Navigation, I heard tell there used to be a big warehouse that
      Pickfords had, it were across the road, a big building but they took half
      of it down.&nbsp; It were all took down years ago but that's where
      Pickfords stored their goods and chattels.&nbsp; [<i>maybe set up in the early 1800s
      but not next to the Navigation - current view is that it was the warehouse
      on the wharf, ie. across the road from the Navigation, that was Pickford's - <a href="arm-map.htm">see map</a></i>]&nbsp; Pickfords &quot;turned to&quot; the ironstone and
      brought loads down from Gayton in a horse and cart and load them into
      boats at the Arm.&nbsp; The ironstone was taken by barge down to the
      furnaces.&nbsp; </span><b>George:</b>&nbsp; Did wagons come down the hill on
      skids?&nbsp; <b>H:</b> No they were wagons and there was a sprag* man to do
      the brakes.&nbsp; Yes, they were taken back up again by horses.&nbsp; [<i>this
      was a mode of delivery of ironstone not mentioned by Eric Tonks in his
      quarrying book.&nbsp; George checked that Henshaw was talking about the
      Sparrow pits but the problem is that Pickfords, according to <a href="http://www.pickfords.co.uk/html/about/aboutpickfords_history2.htm"> their potted
      history</a>,
      are supposed to have abandoned
      canal based operations by 1850, before any ironstone mining had started up
      - a mystery perhaps explained by the gradual absorption of beer through
      the course of the recording - Henshaw's mate had seemed to have fallen asleep!</i>]</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Mercifully the
      recording stopped
      abruptly, as they often did, probably because the tape ran out.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">* the gung-ho
      method of controlling a wagon with a stick through the spokes can be credited
      for wagons not exceeding 1 mph speed.&nbsp; Otherwise the sprag-man would
      use chocks before the wheels and these are easily run over unless the
      chocks are captive in a braking mechanism.</font></p>
