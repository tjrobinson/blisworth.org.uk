        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">It
        seems likely that before the building of the canal and its Northampton
        Arm, this area shown as Lot 21 <a href="Arm-general.htm#map">in the general
        map</a> was merely the most northern limit of Blisworth parish common
        land.&nbsp; The land had probably been common land for over 500 years
        and would have been included in the Honour of Grafton by Charles II and
        conferred upon a young Fitzroy in 1705, the first Duke of Grafton.</font></span></p>
        <p><img src="map.jpg" width="380" align="left" height="409">
        <span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        Arm was established in 1815.&nbsp; Ordnance Survey maps dated 1899 show
        a brickworks adjacent to the Arm, as in the general map, but there is no
        reference in the Grafton rent records to a brickmaker until 1919 when William T.
        Asplin purchases, <i> prior to</i> auction for the sum of £875, this loading wharf and the 13 acre
        field, Lot 22, on the other side of the railway (see inset map).&nbsp; There is no
        record of how long brickmaking had been practiced in this general location but
        it seems likely to have sprung up, as in other places, alongside the
        intended path of the Grand Junction Canal, ie. circa 1793.&nbsp;
        Evidently Asplin used the wharf for moving bricks and sand and it was
        probably used by&nbsp;<a href="arm-stories.htm#savage"> Mr. Savage</a> 
        before him.&nbsp;
        In 1922 there is an interesting letter from Millner reminding Asplin
        that the use of the boat &quot;GJCCC Blisworth&quot; will be charged at
        5/- per day.&nbsp; And we thought the only boats that were named Blisworth were
        part of the <a href="../../MV&#32;Blisworth/mvblisworth.htm">canal
        company's sea-going shipping line</a>.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        main Lot 20 was purchased by the GJCCC with tenancy rights in favour of
        Asplin.&nbsp; However, there is a <a href="arm-stories.htm#asplin">chance
        reference by a labourer</a> to Asplin taking down his brickworks and
        reestablishing them on the other side of the canal at a time shortly
        after 1919.&nbsp; This suggests that arrangements with GJCCC had not gone well for
        him and he was setting up brickmaking within his 13
        acre field, as has been independently confirmed.&nbsp; Asplin's bricks
        are easily recognisable; they have no frog but instead have a series of
        holes running through them.&nbsp; This feature allows a more compact
        furnace arrangement in which hot gasses pass through the bricks during
        kilning.&nbsp; Bricks from other Gayton and Milton Malsor brickworks are
        plain and wire-cut on three axes.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        descendants of William T. Asplin c1950 were Milton farmers along with a sister
        living in Milton Malsor and another farmer, <a href="../../Common/housing.htm#asplin"> Henry Thomas
        Asplin</a>, who lived at
        Home Farm, Blisworth.&nbsp; In 1948, by which time brickmaking elsewhere
        had
        become very industrialised, an 8 acre portion of the field, including a gravel
        pit, was sold to the engineering firm Kottler and Heron Company and in
        1951 the remainder was sold to the Stroud family (F. Stroud and Sons)
        who also bought the (Old) Arm Farm, 150 acres - roughly that area run by
        the Dix family and later the Savage family.&nbsp; Kottler and Heron
        eventually acquired the rest of the Asplin plot c1960 from William
        Capell who had by then bought the farm.&nbsp; Kottler and Heron also
        demolished Asplin's brickworks leaving one general purpose building.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        strip of land referred to in Deeds as a loading wharf, original Lot 21, was sold in 1951 to John C. Mason who is believed to
        have used the plot as a base for landing by canal and storing road stone
        (granite and chippings) either for his own work or by arrangement with a
        'local' road-mender employed by the Towcester Rural District
        Council.&nbsp; Note that the house at the top of Little Lane in
        Blisworth had a similar status up until the 1980s with a <a href="../../Highstone.htm#steamroller">steam-roller
        shed</a> built next to it.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Mason
        subsequently sold the plot to Frank P. Lantsbery (Transport Driver) and
        his wife in 1962.&nbsp; It is believed the property was given the name
        &quot;Fairlawns&quot; by the Lantsberys and in a rapidly newly expanding
        Blisworth, before the advent of postcodes, it became a problem for many
        people to recall where on earth this place could be, the local roads
        layout being hard to fathom.&nbsp; It was under
        the &quot;Lantsbery watch&quot; that the plot acquired a rather idyllic
        charm harmonising with a shady and peaceful reach of canal water.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Lantsberys used the wharf as a weekend/holiday retreat from
        Northampton and converted one of the buildings from the rudimentary
        accommodation set up by the previous owner into a more comfortable
        holiday abode. Commercial traffic had ceased on the canal by this
        time.&nbsp; The leisure industry was just beginning and the Lantsberys
        experimented with the hire of Indian Canoes and rowing boats. When this
        proved to be more trouble than it was worth, they sub-let the moorings
        on the wharf to a succession of boat owners. They even leased the
        adjacent field from British Waterways and sublet moorings there.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When
        the wharf, with the same plot as specified in 1919, was bought by Philip
        Lizius and Mrs. Linda Childerhouse in 1993 it was renamed &quot;The Sand
        Landings&quot; in recognition of the fact that the nearby bridge (No. 3)
        was known as 'Sandlanding' presumably because of Mr. Asplin's or any
        earlier brickmaker or builder's activities at the wharf.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p></font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The plot retains the same appeal.&nbsp;
        In the summer of 1996 there was a visitor to Sand Landings, an elderly
        gentleman who, as a small boy in the 1920s, had led his uncle's boat
        horses down the flight.&nbsp; The boats carried bricks from a Milton
        brickworks to build new houses in Far Cotton - very likely the Asplin
        brickworks on the other side of the railway.&nbsp; Asplin lived at
        Milton but his works near Sandlanding bridge were* in Blisworth
        parish.&nbsp; It was a pity the man
        didn't leave his name for there might have been a link with men
        discussing, in 1961, the <a href="arm-stories.htm">use of the wharf</a>,
        which we have on tape.</font></span></p>

        The Kottler and Heron site and a large square of land to the south of it
        was
        transferred to the Parish of Milton Malsor in the 1980s, by unilateral
        application by the Milton Malsor PC to the Boundaries Commission,
        because it was expected that they
        would benefit from &quot;rates&quot; revenues.&nbsp; The larger square
        was in anticipation of a substantial expansion in a commercial estate
        that was eventually abandoned.&nbsp; It was a pyrrhic move, for even
        if a commercial activity is allowed in future, the result of a policy change in
        local government funding means that <i> parish councils can no longer obtain such
        rates income</i>!</span></font></p>
