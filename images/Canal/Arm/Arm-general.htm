      ie 1066</b> - this would all be 'waste' land; nothing the Normans cared to
      make a note of except for a track, part of the very old <b><a href="../../Development/Routes/maptext.htm">Oxenford Way</a></b> trading route, probably dating
        from the 8th century if Offa of Mercia established it, ran through
        the area on a roughly north-south axis joining Oxford and Northampton
        via Greens Norton and Tiffield parish.&nbsp; [One theory supposes that
      the ancient way coincides with the axis of the road through Blisworth Arm,
      another supposes it follows the road from Gayton, in the immediate
      vicinity, and joins a little to the east of the Arm End.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Medieval</b> -
        &nbsp; Imagine just this track, dividing the parishes of Blisworth and
        Gayton, and fields
        for half-mile all round.&nbsp; Gayton parish was inclosed very early
        whilst this part of Blisworth parish was not inclosed until c1800.&nbsp; There would just be the locals toiling all day at their furrows, listening out for the village bell to toll
        their &quot;tea-time&quot;.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1757</b> - The entire
      area to the south of the track was part of common land
        called nether field or Blisworth Field.&nbsp; The nearest enclosed field (The
        Lowne) was let to Wm. Plowman, a descendant of a beneficiary of the 1650
        Cromwell crown land purchases.&nbsp; By the time of the Grafton Survey
      in 1757 most farmers who were
        judged to be good farmers were awarded some grant of
        inclosure over parts of the common land so the &quot;ridge and
        furrow&quot; pattern of family farming was being pushed out.&nbsp; The
      track might be less maintained than in medieval times, running along the Blisworth and
        Gayton parish boundary, probably chiefly serving the already inclosed fields
        (c1600) in Gayton parish.&nbsp; The 'trading route' had been transferred long
        ago to an old road passing through Blisworth that was soon to be upgraded to a
        turnpike (thence the A43).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1794</b> - The main cut of
        the <b> Grand Junction Canal</b> was established as far south as
        the turnpike in Blisworth village, where a transhipping wharf was
        created.&nbsp; The locals would not see the point of this man-made
        'river' . . . yet.&nbsp; The track is bent a bit and forms the
      beginnings of a short street through a hamlet.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1805</b> -
        Joining the Grand Junction Canal there was dug a ~150 yard long waterway that <a href="../horse_rail_wharf.htm">
        led to a horse railway</a> connecting the canal to Northampton.&nbsp;
        The place was called <b>Northampton Arm</b> and remained such until
      about 1891 when the name Blisworth Arm was used in the census.&nbsp;<b> </b>Pickfords moved from Blisworth wharfs to the Arm to operate the horse
        railway, having operated the Blisworth Hill railway from 1800 - 1805
        while the tunnel was being finished.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small
        farm of about 50 acres (?) was inclosed and assigned to tenant John
      Dix - it probably rapidly expanded to a 152 acre farm later known as (Old)
      Arm Farm.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1807</b> - a public house was
        opened and believed to be called initially The New Inn (for not more
        than 20 years), later named the Navigation Inn - <a href="../../neighbour-one.htm">photographs</a>.&nbsp;
        On the 13 January 1806, George Moore invoiced the Duke of Grafton
        £1&nbsp; 16. 0. for the wooden scaffolding (skafles) for a public house
        at Railway End, Blisworth Field.&nbsp; In the 1809 Award map it is shown as an unlabelled
        (farm) house in the corner of a large field.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">See details in

        A name such as Railway End gave way to <b>Arm End</b>.&nbsp; Pickfords, a company with its roots in the 17th century, also operated

        A feature
        of uncertain dating was the bridge
        built across the neck of The Arm extending to the Toll Cottage - Bridge No.1.&nbsp;
        Presumably it was a relatively flimsy affair of wood, for pedestrians
        especially the toll-man, being a swing bridge, probably a floating one, to allow boats into the Arm.&nbsp;
        It was
        flanked with staging to the bank on the cottage side and joined to a
        substantial peninsula of land on the other side as shown in the <a href="arm-map.htm"> detailed

        named his operational base there &quot;Gayton Maintenance Yard&quot;, consistent with

      Cottage.&nbsp; This is of course <b>C. Hadlow</b>.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b><a name="war"></a>War
        Years</b> - It is thought that Hadlow possibly shared his house during
        the war years when the whole canal network was 'taken over' by the
        government.&nbsp; The Toll Cottage was accommodation for a government
        official and his family, Ernest G. Dale, who described himself as a GUCCC employee and whose job it was to manage the storage of
        strategic emergency foods.&nbsp; In 1940 Dale took over the R.O.P. depot
      after the petrol tanks and pumps <b> had all been removed</b> and started to store
      foodstuffs.&nbsp; By 1942/3 his operation must have transferred into the much
      favoured Blisworth (Westley) mill building which had become GUCCC property by then (see link below for John Dale's memoirs).&nbsp;
      Aerial photos of 1947 (NRO) show one small shed and an empty plot
      accommodating a looped drive with in- and out-gates.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>1946</b>
        - GUCCC let the old disused petrol depot, newly referred to as Depot
      No.3, to Derngate Motors for a while
      and then opted to again offer it to petrol and oil companies [<i>there
      must have been some canal benefit from this?</i>] &nbsp;People recall Esso,
      Texaco and Shell being involved but the most 'solid' seems to be that the depot was
      used by Watsons Oils (part of Texaco) -

        - The management of the canal system, whilst still controlled by
      government, was re-organised as the British Waterways Board which begat <b>British Waterways</b>.&nbsp;
        By now the annual charge for fishing rights had been increased by
        British Waterways to £200 per mile</font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">
        </span></font><font color="#000080">which resulted in different clubs taking over the waters.&nbsp;
        They used to come out by bus and were dropped off at bridge points.&nbsp;
        It became a little industry - some canal-side houses providing tea, hot water, sandwiches and
        confectionery.&nbsp; The push and pull train on the local line would drop off and pick up by request at suitable spots such as
        the Banbury Lane crossing.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1960s</b>
        - British Waterways appreciated the excellent clay, for puddling,
        available at the site of Asplin's old brickworks (Lot 20) and <a href="../../Misc-just.htm#clay">proceeded
        to extract it</a>.&nbsp; The resulting large hollow filled with water at
        a level somewhat below that of the neighbouring Arm and even acquired a
        colony of water lilies (<a href="../../Misc-just.htm#lilies">photographed
        by Walter Alexander</a>) and its own clandestine flock of fishermen who
        parked on the <a href="../horse_rail_wharf.htm#track">horse railway 'track'</a>
        and crept through narrow gaps in the hedge.&nbsp; The place became known
      as <b> The Lake</b> and there were voices heard 20 years hence in Blisworth -
      &quot;we want to keep our Lake&quot;.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1960
      -70</b> - Arm Farm was bought by Harry Capell of Shutlanger and, in 1963, a new farm house was established near Canal House and named New Arm
      Farm.&nbsp; Hence a modified name for the main farm - Old Arm Farm.&nbsp;
      Not long afterwards, c 1970, the farm buildings along the road opposite the yard
      were modernised.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1967
        </b>- After Station Road was adopted and <a href="../../Rails.htm#station road"> officially named</a> (eight years
        after there was no station!) by <b>NCC</b> there was the question of
        signage to the Arm.&nbsp; George Freeston saw fit to lobby County officials that the name of
        this hamlet should remain as <b>Blisworth Arm</b> and not be transformed
      into Gayton Arm!&nbsp;
        There has been good natured discussion ever since - see 1980 entry.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>1975</b>
      - Brabs Baillion purchased a north section of the wharf next to the yard,
      thus presumably merging with the Canal House curtilage which then would be
      extended right to the water edge (annotations to old conveyance at Head
      Office, British Waterways noticed by D. Blagrove).</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>1980</b>
        - A boat marina was established by enlarging and profiling The Lake in the area that was earlier used as a
        source of clay for bricks and canal use.&nbsp; The company was initially
        &quot;Freshwater Marine&quot; and they named the marina &quot;Gayton
        Water&quot;.&nbsp; Alvechurch Leisure and ABC Leisure Group have since called it
        &quot;Gayton Marina&quot;.&nbsp; An early company statement explained they wished to
        avoid annoyance to locals and confusion with any businesses in Blisworth.
        It was not going to be easy but they decided to follow GJCCC. (British Waterways)
        with their designation &quot;<b>Gayton Junction</b>&quot; for the canals there
        and &quot;Gayton Maintenance Yard&quot; for their operations there even
        though it resides within Blisworth parish.&nbsp; Besides, the marina is
        on the Gayton Road from Milton Malsor.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>1983</b>
      - The building that was once a pub, Navigation Cottage, was extended by
      the owners, the Holmes family, using the space occupied by stables (latterly
      a garage) and loft.&nbsp; The loft was the <a href="arm-stories.htm#loft">sleeping
      quarters mentioned by Thomas Henshaw</a>.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>1991</b>
        - The <a href="../../Bypass&#32;History.htm"> Blisworth and Milton Malsor A43 Bypass</a> was completed.&nbsp; It uses a section of the
        levels built for the Northampton and Peterborough railway branch line.&nbsp;
        Note the access roads put in on the A43 and just visible in the Google
        image below.&nbsp; They have not been put to any use because projects to commercially develop land in the Arm area,
        on both sides of the main road, were quashed at the enquiry stage.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>2007</b>
        - May, <a href="../Marina/New-Marina.htm"> a new marina</a> west of the
        Grand Union Canal was opened - &quot;<b>Blisworth Marina</b>&quot;.&nbsp;
        The excavation involved the removal of 100s tonnes of, unsurprisingly,
        clay.&nbsp; However, a deep seam of particularly good clay for puddling
        canals and marinas etc. was found and used there.&nbsp; The extra depth
        of hole created by removing 'best clay' was backfilled with 'second rate
        clay'.</span></font>

        - Attempts to develop the hamlet, with a small housing project, were refused planning
        permission as the hamlet seriously lacks both access and parking

      - A growing environmental awareness has
        resulted in attention being focussed on the neglected state of the plot
        once occupied by the R.O.P. Company (see above) and improvement by the
        owners is imminent.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An information board has been
      recently installed by British Waterways at the Arm junction.&nbsp; It draws attention to the turnover
      bridge, the Toll house, the yard, the Navigation and Canal House thus
      covering the most obvious of the historical features.&nbsp; The board is
      entitled &quot;Gayton Junction&quot; to align with British Waterways
      custom dating from c1920 and, unfortunately, not &quot;<i>Northampton Arm
      Junction</i>&quot; which would have recalled the c1805 years, thus
      broadening the historical perspective.</span></font>

      - After years of lobbying the NCC, there was set up proper highway signage
      in August at the end of Station Road near the railway arch.&nbsp; Future
      difficulties in, for example, an ambulance finding the Arm should be
      lessened.</span></font>
