        </font></b><font color="#000080">This UK company with Russian trade
        connections was set up in 1924 and succeeded in creating a creditable
        distribution network within one year for competitively priced petrol.&nbsp;
        From 1931, it held a
        depot on the canal at Blisworth Arm.&nbsp; A Gayton resident remembers the R.O.P.
        lorries going<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>through
        Gayton in the early 1930’s to/from the A5 (they called them
        &quot;Rotten Old Petrol&quot;) but were they restocking the depot or
        distributing from it?&nbsp; The correspondence with GUCCC indicates that
        R.O.P. wanted to ship by canal from Brentford to the Northampton area. &nbsp; The company would have disappeared from view in
        1939 when the UK Government's petroleum board was created.&nbsp; It may
        well have contributed in wartime to the wholesale petrol and paraffin
        market.&nbsp; But not from this site for in 1940 it was retaken by GUCCC
        and the petrol tanks and pipes and pump were removed.&nbsp; By 1948, when the board was wound up, the USSR was the enemy
        and the assets were sold to Regent Oil Company.&nbsp; The depot was used
        by a long list of tenants - <a href="ROP.htm#depot">see below</a>.&nbsp;
        Surprisingly, the company actual still exists with offices in
        London.&nbsp; These days they have only a small residential portfolio to
        care for.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font SIZE="3"><font color="#000080">Here, an attempt is made to bring together what
        is known about the Russian Oil Products Ltd. company. Much of the
        historical narrative here is based on a publication by the Competition
        Commission on petrol distribution in the UK, 1914 - 1970.&nbsp; The
        motivation comes from the knowledge that a small depot was set up in
        1931 on the canal at
        Blisworth Arm.&nbsp; Little is
        known of the activities at the depot but the rationale for its position in the East
        Midlands was clearly to bring stock in via the canal - indeed a
        condition imposed by the canal company for the lease on the land was
        that the canal would be used (p.92, &quot;Two Centuries of Service&quot;
        D. Blagrove).&nbsp; The Russian directors were initially S. L. Naguinsky
        and P. Bytchkoff.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">During the 1914-1918 war the British Government
        became the sole importer of petroleum products. Distribution of petrol
        remained in the hands of the existing petrol companies, each of which
        was allotted a fixed percentage related to its previous share of the
        market and given sole rights of distribution in a particular area. The
        Government controlled both the wholesale selling prices and the
        distributing companies' profit margin. This pattern was to be repeated
        during the second World War, despite the large increase in the number of
        supply companies. After the war private motoring and the commercial use
        of vehicles developed rapidly, with a consequent increase in the
        consumption of petrol and in the number of retailers selling petrol.
        Little initial capital was required; petrol dispensing equipment was
        obtainable from the petrol companies on payment of a small deposit, with
        very generous repayment periods, and the petrol companies undertook
        maintenance. In 1920 Anglo-American introduced the first hand-operated
        petrol pumps with underground storage tanks of 300-to 500-gallon
        capacity. Thereafter any site which had previously sold petrol in cans
        was regarded as a potential pump site and equipment manufacturers and
        petrol companies both competed to secure orders or representation. By
        1929 there were some 28,000 retail outlets with more than twice as many
        pumps; by 1938 there were over 35,000 outlets with some 100,000 pumps
        and an average annual throughput of 24,000 gallons per station or 8,500
        gallons per pump. Many stations provided efficient service; others were
        failures and were abandoned and later became derelict.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">There were 4 nationalised supply companies and some
        'independent'. Among the independents the chief ones were Power Petroleum Co.
        Ltd. (established in 1923) and Russian Oil Products (R.O.P., established
        in 1924) both of which distributed Russian petrol imported from Batum on
        the Black Sea. Both sold at prices
        below those of the national companies and both achieved considerable
        success.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><img height="157" src="zip-badge.jpg" width="200" align="left">
        In an attempt to counter the dependence on sales of oil to the biggest
        Western companies, the Bolshevik government began, in 1924, actively
        developing its own distribution network abroad, especially in countries
        where the Soviet products were already known to the consumers.&nbsp; In August
        of that year, a Soviet company called Russian Oil Products opened
        business on British territory, its objective being to organize retail
        trade in Britain.&nbsp; The legal grounds for its operations were provided by
        the Anglo-Russian trade agreement of 1921.&nbsp; By the beginning of 1925,
        this firm had set up its own trading system, built oil distribution
        storage facilities in Bristol and Cardiff, and entered into fierce
        competition with local companies. In the initial stages, Russian Oil
        Products pursued a dumping policy, selling petroleum products for 1-3
        pence less than other firms did. The Soviet company managed to grasp a
        place on the British market: of the 250 thousand tons of oil imported
        into Britain over the first nine months of 1925, Soviet petroleum
        products accounted for about a fifth, marketed under the brand
        &quot;ZIP&quot; at 11½d per gallon compared to 1/3d. from the
        'nationals'.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Despite attempts by the national companies to
        counter the activities of the independents, the sales of the
        independents received further encouragement from the rise in the price
        of petrol on the world market and the introduction in 1928 of a tax on
        petrol in the United Kingdom. The effect was to stimulate the buying
        public's interest in cut-price petrol and, because of the
        competition between the national companies and the independents, no
        company was willing to increase its prices. The price level in the
        United Kingdom is said to have become unprofitable to the suppliers at
        this time. In January, 1929 the national companies and the larger
        independents reached agreement in that branding of outlets with clear
        indication of prices would become the norm whilst some wholesale trading
        between companies worked to even out price differences. The maintained
        retail prices typically became 1/5d. for R.O.P. and 1/7d. per gallon for
        the nationals, the duty being 9d.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080">The Petroleum Board and the 1939-1945 World War</font></p>
        </b>
  </center>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">In the summer of 1938 the principal suppliers
        in the United Kingdom - namely Anglo-American, National Benzole,
        Standard Oil <i>&amp; </i>B.P. and Trinidad Leaseholds - joined together
        with Government approval to form the Petroleum Board. There is no
        mention of the status of R.O.P. in relation to the Board. The Board was
        initially a voluntary body set up to consider the problems of petroleum
        distribution which would arise in the event of war. On 3rd September
        1939 the Board's recommendations became effective and the Board itself
        became an executive body working under Government direction. The
        physical assets, working capital and manpower of all petrol companies in
        the United Kingdom were pooled, each company receiving remuneration and
        depreciation on the assets contributed at agreed rates; prices,
        quantities and qualities of petroleum products came under Government
        control and competitive marketing between suppliers ceased; products
        were supplied by the members of the Board as far as possible in
        proportion to their pre-war deliveries, all (except lubricants) were
        sold under a Pool description, the selling price of each Pool product
        being subject to Government control. The controlled prices were as far
        as possible fixed with a view to covering the costs of the Board without
        providing any profit. In the case of petrol, one grade only was made
        available. Supplies for civilian use were rationed. By agreement between
        H.M. Government and the Board, pooling arrangements were to end not
        more than two years after the end of the state of emergency. Actually
        the Petroleum Board was not dissolved until June 1948. It is noteworthy
        that the R.O.P. Ltd company was sold to Regent Oil in 1948 and thence
        was absorbed into Texaco. The use of the depot however was taken up by
        Watson's Petrol Company which had already become one of the outlets for
        ZIP petrol before the war.&nbsp; After the war however, Watson's would
        have distributed Fina products.<a name="depot"></a></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Wartime Use: </b>George Freeston noted that the
        GUCCC. re-occupied the site in 1940 and that in the period 1940
        to approx. 1980 the site was used for - (i). &quot;Pool&quot; petrol
        depot [<i>plausible only if the fuel was brought there in lorry-tankers
        that stayed till empty</i>] , (ii). Northants farmers - a fuel depot, (iii). Derngate Motor Company
        - storage of exWD vehicles, (iv). Regent Oils, (v). Texaco Petrols,
        (vi).
        Watson petroleum and (vii). Mr. Peter Stock - metal construction business
        having moved from opposite the mill in Blisworth - but not necessarily in that exact order.&nbsp; George,
        with his first item, is thus lending support to the idea that, during the war, the depot was kept open for
        special local use, that is, it could have functioned as a
        discreet depot for petrol and paraffin users such as local farmers who
        were not subject to the strictures of wartime rationing but only once
        the food storage had been <a href="Arm-general.htm#war"> mostly moved to the
        mill</a>.&nbsp; A Millner
        letter contradicts this view as there is reference to tanks and pumps
        being removed in 1940.&nbsp; The local farmer H.
        Osborne's records for 1942 and 1943 show that he bought 50 gallons of petrol and 200
        gallons of paraffin at a place he referred to as
        &quot;The Pool&quot; or &quot;The Board&quot;.&nbsp; At first it seems
        he could have visited a depot rather than a 'street vendor' for such
        large quantities but, as pointed out by the farmer's daughter, who was
        14 at the time, he was only allowed to buy and carry petrol up to 4
        gallons and cannot recall any visits to any local depot.&nbsp; The
        reference in the farmer's records to 50 gallons must have been in
        relation to a month's total; probably bought at Freeston's in the High
        Street.&nbsp; So it seems that R.O.P. Ltd was in no
        way involved at the Arm after 1940.&nbsp; They may well have continued to supply wholesale to the board throughout the
        war for as long as maritime conditions permitted.</font></p>

        </b>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><img height="176" src="volodarsky.jpg" width="117" align="left">
        <a name="spies"></a>A released Home Office file (HO 144/17917) deals with concern that R.O.P. Ltd.
        were engaged in dubious activities circa from July 1932 to August 1933.
        Officials were concerned that this company was being used as a base for
        communist political activities leading to espionage and sabotage. Apart
        from the Home Office severely limiting the large number of applicants to
        join the board of R.O.P. Ltd., there are files which include profiles of
        communist activists and employees, both Russian and British, and
        submissions from surveillance officers and ex-employees. For example, in
        1932 Volodarsky, clumsily posing as a Romanian journalist, offered
        bribes to Shell Mex employees in return for oil industry information.
        Volodarsky was in fact an OGPU agent, posing in Britain under cover of
        being employed by Russian Oil Products. At this time Volodarsky was
        living at 160 Highbury New Park, an address associated at the time with
        many Soviet agents.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">R.O.P. Ltd. had offices both in London and in
        Dublin. The Irish also became concerned with the activities in Dublin.
        Later, security files also disclose that MI5 kept a close watch on the
        company which was suspected of being a cover for Soviet espionage during
        wartime.&nbsp; The antics of one dubious character,
        William Denis Kendall, is linked to R.O.P.Ltd. in a way that &quot;is
        not clear&quot;.&nbsp; This wartime topic might have
        induced Anthony Blunt, who worked at MI5 at the time, to pay a visit to
        Blisworth and stay at the Hotel just after the war. His visit is recorded in a
        Blisworth Hotel register that appeared on Ebay early in 2009.&nbsp; Blunt's
        involvement, of course, could have been 'motivated' from either side!&nbsp;
        By 1938 R.O.P. Ltd. had 35 depots across England, one of which was at
        the Arm just a ½ mile from the hotel, and it has been claimed that
        most were staffed by members of the Communist Party.&nbsp; But what
        would the point have been of Blunt's visit after the war with the depot
        disused for 5 years?&nbsp; Perhaps he was there to check that a good
        'cover-up' had been staged.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><img height="136" src="zip37gb.jpg" width="173" align="left">
        Probably stimulated by its unpopularity re. 'dumping', there was a
        campaign in the 1930’s conducted by a national newspaper to boycott
        Russian oil, being offered in the UK by Russian Oil Products through a
        subsidiary in the Medway. Because the first letters of the full name
        made MOSCO, the subsidiary was taken to have Soviet connections (which
        of course it had anyway), and so it had to publish reassurances as to its
        fully non-Soviet, British and independent nature! As often happens, the
        resultant publicity of this campaign ensured that &quot;Power
        Petrol&quot;, the
        other main independent brand, became more of a household name and that in
        fact it was a good fuel at a cheap price <u> and</u>, latterly, was manufactured in Britain.&nbsp;
        R.O.P. were also active in marketing; they were unusual in giving away
        their maps of Britain, one of which had a sketch map of the company's
        Russian oil fields near the Caspian Sea on the back cover - a feature one can just make out
        from the inset picture.</font></p>
