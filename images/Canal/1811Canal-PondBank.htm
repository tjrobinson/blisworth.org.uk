AS A BASIS</font></b></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000080" size="3">There is also a <a href="../blisworth_water_mill.htm">1729
map of the Mill Area</a> including fields to the north.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">The black and white part of the map below is a copy of a
photocopy found in the GF 1996 collection at the NRO.&nbsp; It is evidently
concerned with canal and water, labelled No 10, dated 1811 and clearly drawn by
or for the Grand Junction Canal Company.&nbsp; The roads appear to be drawn far too
wide and with casual precision compared to the line of the canal between bridges
no. 50 and 51, which is faithfully mapped.&nbsp; Unfortunately there are no buildings included such as the
Half Moon Inn at 'A' or the Dukes Arms Inn at 'B'.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Some comments about the <a href="1811Canal-PondBank.htm#water">water courses and the
millpond</a>, the <a href="1811Canal-PondBank.htm#roads">position of roads</a> and<br>
finally, <a href="1811Canal-PondBank.htm#misc">miscellany</a>, are made below.&nbsp; If the links in
the preceding sentence are used, it<br>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><img border="0" src="1811-GJC.jpg" width="600" height="559"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><a name="water"></a><u><b>Water Courses and
the Mill Pond</b><br>
</u>The map shows two streams that were there before the construction of the
canal.&nbsp; One from Gayton Wood and one from <a href="../Fisher/Fishweir.htm"> Fisher Close (or the
Fishweir)</a> to
the south of the village, as they were positioned in 1793.&nbsp; Dent's mill was
enjoying the collection of the water from one stream going into a small reservoir and
such reservoir is evident in the <a href="../1727-map.htm"> 1729 Grafton Survey
map</a>.&nbsp; As stated <a href="../mills-blisworth.htm">elsewhere</a>, Grafton had clearly decided to drain the mill pond prior to 1729 to
provide a meadow.&nbsp; Every civil engineer will know that the effective way to
clear an area of water is to dig a duct on both sides of the area, at the same
level - in this
case, one for each of the two streams.&nbsp; No records exist before 1729 so it is
a&nbsp; matter of speculation when the mill-pond was drained.&nbsp; Perhaps it
was around
1650 when farming methods were improving and the first few inclosures were
made.&nbsp; The layout tends to confirm that the mill pond was once capable of
extending over the <u> whole area</u> shaded blue, it being level (otherwise the cuttings
for a stream on each side would not be effective in draining the area).&nbsp; The area is named Pond Bank
Leys and in all maps there is a distinct boundary aligned with the east stream
which parts the paddocks of properties on the High Street.&nbsp; Both streams
drained into the channel which runs down to Lady Bridge near to Northampton, a
stream now called <a href="../Sanitation/sewage-water.htm"> Wash Brook</a>.&nbsp; After the completion of the canal, the
stream from Gayton Wood would just run into the canal, as it does now.&nbsp; The
water from Fisher was ducted to pour into the canal near to the tunnel portal
and so would no longer supply the miller's reservoir.&nbsp; That stream on the eastern
boundary would
carry a little water only at times of sustained wet weather.&nbsp; Any milling at the mill ceased well before
that however; the miller, Richard Dent, sold the mill to the GJC in
1794, and a garden somewhere nearby, and thereafter concentrated on <a href="../mills-blisworth.htm"> wind-milling on Cliff Hill</a> as indicated on
the 1815 Award map.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">By 1838 when a rather precise map was prepared for the Grafton Survey of that
year, the reservoir had been tidied up into <a href="../1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_Chapel_Ln_1838.jpg"> the form of a small sump</a> which
drained by underground culvert into Wash Brook.&nbsp; That sump is located at
the small red square in the above map.&nbsp; It was filled in around 1880 and
was not disturbed again until around 1968 when a thorough <a href="../Pondbank.htm#draining"> draining of the area</a>
was planned prior to filling it with housing.&nbsp; Old timers in the village at
that time warned the builders they would have trouble with that field.&nbsp;
Their warnings proved correct - the builders found it was necessary to extend
the foundation brickwork of some houses at the northern end to a depth of over
ten feet and the western side of the area tends to get water-logged in winter.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">As close as can be judged, the location of the overshot water wheel at Dent's
mill was at the lowest point of Chapel Lane, on the hedge side of the
road.&nbsp; Some maps show the mill centred in an 'island' between roads.&nbsp;
This suggests the existence of both a low path and a high path.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><a name="roads"></a><u><b>Roads</b><br>
</u>There are two striking differences in road alignment compared to what would
be expected.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">First the position of Gayton Road adjacent to Blisworth
Wharf.&nbsp; In this map there appears to be no room for the wharf yards shown
on the <a href="../West&#32;Bridge/west-end.htm">1807 map</a> and the <a href="../1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_Wharf_1838.jpg"> 1838 map</a> of this area.&nbsp; Perhaps, briefly,
wharf and road were one and the same.&nbsp; If no buildings were required
initially that would make sense.&nbsp; Note that the 1807 map is somewhat
dubious in that it could be a blend of features, some of them as late as 1838.&nbsp;
The 1838 map agrees precisely with the present day ordnance survey maps and the
green dotted line indicates the path of the Gayton Road.&nbsp; Both this path,
and the one depicted in black above, comfortably 'go around' the old house near
the corner now known as &quot;The Bays&quot;.&nbsp; It is very tempting to think
that the original line of the Gayton Road was quite close to the canal but,
before long, the need for more room at the wharfs (perhaps for buildings etc.)
required that the road be re-routed.&nbsp; In fact the Award map of 1815 shows
the road in its later position.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Second, a part of the Blisworth bypass is shown but it <i>points</i>
to a junction with the Northampton road near to Cliff Hill farm.&nbsp; To
demonstrate the point, the position of the Baptist Chapel that would be built in
1825 is shown by the hollow red square.&nbsp; Note also the curved spur road in the above map turning off the bypass into the
Pond Bank Leys - or indeed, it seems, entirely hijacking the road, from the
bridge end, for the access to the field.&nbsp; This was perhaps to provide a better access at that time to the field
than provided from Chapel Lane.&nbsp;&nbsp; That the detail was included in a
GJC map hints that it was the GJC that required the access to the field.&nbsp; Then there is the alignment of the
bypass (which
of course was never built) that is <a href="../1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_Chapel_Ln_1838.jpg"> suggested in 1838</a>
which was to cross Chapel Lane (or Mill
Lane) in the vicinity of the 'en' in the word 'Dents' in the above map and join
the Northampton road at the railway arch.&nbsp; Clearly, the idea of a bypass
was being considered for many decades.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080">Finally, it is evident that the map-maker
in 1811 was not that bothered
about the exact mapping of roads, for the alignment of the High Street at the Half
Moon Inn (A) is far too southerly.&nbsp; Dingley Lane running adjacent to the
Dukes Arms Inn (B) should be aligned far nearer to parallel with the road to
Towcester.&nbsp; These points tend to detract from the
authenticity of the map in regard to roads and makes us question the theory
regarding the re-alignment of the Gayton Road, discussed above.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><a name="misc"></a><u><b>Miscellany</b><br>
</u>The four-sided irregularly shaped fields in the northern corner of the map are
recognisable as a portion of the medieval ridge and furrow-cultivated north&nbsp;
field (Nether field).&nbsp; There is no indication of a brick works near to
bridge 50 (later to be known as Candle Bridge).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">A 'Double Stop Gate' is labelled near bridge
50 as it is also in the 1807 map.&nbsp; A stop gate is a wooden gate similar to
a lock gate that can be used to dam the canal in the event of a leak or need for
repairs, but which is normally kept open.&nbsp; Why it was described as a
'double' is a mystery.&nbsp; There is no remnant of the
structure at the present time. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">There is no indication on the 1807 or 1838
maps of an overflow weir set to deposit surplus water into Wash Brook.&nbsp; A
weir was first placed just north of bridge 50, at a date unknown.&nbsp; It
became redundant in 1958 when a larger one was built <a href="../Pondbank.htm#weir">just
south of the bridge</a> and was finally sealed shortly after the September 1992
floods.</font></p>
