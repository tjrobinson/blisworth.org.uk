pictures reproduced at the bottom of this page have been recently taken looking first east and then west from a location about
by the end of the word &quot;Northampton&quot; just to the north of the area now occupied by Gayton
Marina.&nbsp; The map in &quot;Neighbouring Villages&quot; shows a well-extended
watery spur presumed running parallel to the railway for a distance, thus in
contrast to the Award map.</font>

with the operation of the horse railway.&nbsp; Also indicated is the probability

<p><font color="#000080">With the establishment of a canal link from the Grand Junction Canal and
Northampton,
history records that a horse rail was first built c. 1805 before a proper single-width
link incorporating
a flight of locks was finished.&nbsp; By about 1815 there would be no further
need for the horse
rail and so it is not included in the map - just the unused spur remained.&nbsp;
The pictures below seem to indicate
remnants of the spur and the track of the railway.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are added some lines in dull red to indicate the path of the horse railway as shown
in <a href="../Tunnel&#32;Toll/tunneltoll.htm"> a recently found map at
the NRO</a> that is probably dated c. 1810.&nbsp; David Blagrove in a private
communication has pointed out that the map was associated with a conveyance,
dated October 20th 1807, for the land taken by the canal.</font>
</p>
        <p><font color="#000080">From an article entitled &quot;Grand Junction Canal Railways&quot;
        (no author disclosed) in The Railway Magazine, 531,Sept 1941,390-392
        there are the following observations. <i>In relation to the rail-road
        over Blisworth Hill from which metals were used for this rail-road,
        Thomas Telford in May 1805 reports that &quot;the space occupied by the
        late rail-road over the hill, by being repaired, will answer the purpose
        of a road for the canal horses and the whole breadth should be retained
        by the company (GJCCC.)&quot; </i>[the toll road now known as Stoke Road
        was built for this purpose - perhaps unknown to Telford] <i>Priestley's
        book of 1831, Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers .., says that
        the communication which was established in 1805 was a double railway
        allowing carriages, going different ways, to pass without
        interruption.&nbsp;&nbsp; A later publication &quot;The Penny
        Cyclopaedia&quot; stated in 1840 that a double railway exists despite
        the fact that the canal arm was completed in May 1st 1815.&nbsp; As the
        Blisworth Hill line was some 2 miles shorter than the link to
        Northampton, it is possible that the balance of rails came from the
        Aylesbury stock.&nbsp; Telford's report includes details of the rail
        link - the downgrades on the line were 1 in 1800 near the main canal, 1
        in 48 in a middle ¾mile section and 1 in 800 near to Duston Mill and the town.&nbsp;
        The termination at the town consists of <b> a very commodious wharf shown in
        the plan</b> below, the location being approximately 160 yards west of
        the South Bridge.&nbsp; The line
        of the railroad followed the Milton Rd for ¼mile </i>[as can be seen in
        the NRO map hyperlinked above]<i> and then followed a course now drawn
        out point-for-point by the Arm, with the railroad once close by the <u>towpath</u>
        side </i>
        [this last detail seems wrong!]<i>.&nbsp; The Burgesses of Northampton in
        1809 were not inclined to consider the railroad as permanent and
        reported, &quot; ..we observe with regret the railway substituted for a
        canal, a mode of communication equally as injurious to this town and
        neighbourhood ... the articles conveyed are subject to great waste,
        breakage and pilfering ..&quot; Such was the reputation of the GJCCC. in
        Northampton.</i>

Looking east - this green way of 100 yards in length points roughly to
        Northampton and is in fact the line of<br>
        the horse railway.&nbsp; The junction with the
Gayton to Milton road is at the far end of this short green way.&nbsp; Note that
        the line of the &quot;Oxenford Wey&quot;, it is thought, follows the
        road occupied by the car and passes Milton Ham.</font></td>

From the same point, turning 180 degrees, this hollow full of scrub besides the
road points to the Arm<br>
        junction and is the probably location of the basin.&nbsp; The 'east-end' canal bridge for the road is just out of sight.</font></td>
