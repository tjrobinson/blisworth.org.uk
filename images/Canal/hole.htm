      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A
      passerby reported to British Waterways that a hole had
        appeared in the middle of a grassy triangle of Waterways land adjacent
        to Candle Bridge, quite near to the canal-side weir.&nbsp; It was
        immediately fenced off.&nbsp; In the following few days the hole
        enlarged itself and presented the inset view on 17th April.&nbsp; Water
        was seen trickling through at a depth of about 8 feet below the turf but
        the hole appeared to be much deeper than that.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        substantial loss of soil, evidenced by the surface collapse, suggests a
        water path that would have generated a scouring action for quite a time.&nbsp; The
        obvious suggestion was that one of the culverts at a depth of 16 to 18
        feet which collect water from the weir and the land-gate may well have collapsed allowing a path for washed soil to go
        into the nearby lake and onwards down to Swan Valley.&nbsp; The trickle
        at a much shallower depth, however, indicated that the land-gate or
        perhaps its brick box may be damaged too.&nbsp; By 24th April it was obvious
        to the BW staff that the wooden paddle in the land-gate had rotted to such an extent that it
        was serving little purpose and, anyway, to provide effective shut-off in
        times of drought it had been more or less completely filled with ash
        silt to seal it.&nbsp; In enquiries it was not possible to ascertain the origin
        of the trickle, being probably a lesser concern anyway.&nbsp; After all,
        this account is <i>not</i>
        supposed to serve as an engineering report.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Early
        in the project, the canal was damned against the weir and gate area to
        remove the pressure of water from the canal.&nbsp; This was done in the
        time-honoured fashion as recorded b Paul Chapman <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Canal/stanking.jpg">whose
        photo of the operation is available</a>.</span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">An
        excavator was used to removed more soil so revealing an old collapsed dry culvert, seen above to the
        left, that was no doubt used to provide in the old days (before the weir was
        built in 1958) a means of flooding in emergencies the adjacent field called
        Pond Bank.&nbsp; The old culvert has been sealed off and is shown in
        light blue in the mock-up schematic on the right.&nbsp; The pale yellow
        circle represents the main hole as seen on 25th April and the smaller
        yellow circle indicates the very deep (12 feet and beyond) hole that is
        evident by the base of the ladder.&nbsp; Note there is an electric cable
        running down into this 'abyss' - someone had probably made an
        inspection.&nbsp; The idea of a breached culvert at roughly where there is a red
        cross seemed very plausible.&nbsp; The culverts, some of them thought to
      be at a depth of about 18
        feet, are shown orange in the schematic.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark blue line near all this
        excavation, both natural and human combined, is the high pressure natural gas conduit,
        12 inches diameter, which steeply banks downwards to pass under
        the canal.&nbsp; At that stage it was not thought to be involved in this
        business.&nbsp; The fine black line passing close to the land-gate is a
        fibre-optic communications line running from London to Birmingham
        carrying a vast number of data channels.&nbsp; Luckily it had been only partially uncovered, in its
        plastic green pipe, at the side of the excavation, far enough out of
        harm's way.&nbsp; It is said the fine payable by BW is £1M per day if
      the link is damaged.&nbsp; True or false, the idea is enough to assure its
      longevity.</font>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;Once the minor leakage had been sorted out the next phase was for a specialist sub-contractor to excavate a massive hole in order to gain safe access to
        the suspected damaged culvert.&nbsp; This was to take several days and,
        in the interests of safety, the hole was roughly backfilled with earth
        whilst the contractors were awaited.</font>

      </center><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Contractors May Gurney and
        British Waterways convened a meeting at the refilled hole to discuss
        tactics.&nbsp; A machine moved in the next day and, by the next, it was
      clear that the trickle of water from either the paddle-box, the weir
      enclosure or the canal bank had not been addressed in the first part of
      the work.&nbsp; The depth of the new hole required that shuttering be
      installed, which was the cause of a slowed down rate of digging.&nbsp; The
      whole area was sealed off to all those not wearing high visibility
      clothing, 'toe-tector' boots and a hard hat.</font>

      the picture above, taken on the morning of July 24th, one can see the
      optic link in its green tubing and a trickle of water, arrowed, that
      seemed to proclaim itself the actual cause of the collapse of the ground
      level back in April and which was seen to disappear under a slab of
      concrete, heading for where exactly - another repair?&nbsp; That slab of
      concrete probably limited the scope of the first noticed collapse.&nbsp;
      It evidently covered a union of culverts from the land-gate and the
      weir.&nbsp; The concrete was barely 7 foot down and its edge can be seen
      in the shot taken in April, near the ladder.&nbsp; The team expected to
      dig no deeper than about 12 feet and believed that the oft-quoted 18 to 20
      feet to be an exaggeration.&nbsp; The trickle was coming from the canal
      bank and would be 'dealt with'.&nbsp; The old dry culvert, by the way, was
      behind the shuttering on the right in this picture.&nbsp; The angle of the
      outline of the concrete aligned with the drop from the weir and the
      location of the manhole; thus the geometry of the culverts was being
      understood.</font>

        After a successful session cutting out the concrete and clearing masses
        of brickwork <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Canal/group.jpg">the team were happy</a> to be left with
        two culvert stumps, one in concrete from the weir and the other of brick
        from the land-gate paddle.&nbsp; The next step was to use heavy ribbed
      plastic sleeves to join up the two outflows with the continuing concrete culvert
      which was peeping behind that
        slantwise board on the left.&nbsp; Then a liberal load of fast flowing
      concrete finished off the work and dispersed the effects of the minor leak
      from the bank.&nbsp; The ribbed sleeving was threaded right up to the weir
      so that no future reliance will be placed on the concrete culverts, this
      at the cost of halving the available diameter and throttling the maximum
      flow possible.&nbsp; Adding rings to the construction as it climbed up
      provided an inspection manhole as can be seen in the picture below taken
      on July 31 - these fellows worked fast.&nbsp; The continuing culvert was
      found to be in bad condition so another large hole was needed to replace
      that too.</font>
