        new marina being built at Blisworth Arm is now fast emerging.&nbsp; This
        view from the railway bridge of a four acre patch of ground between canal
        and railway was taken in November.&nbsp; The aim of the project is to
        provide a considerable increase in numbers of moorings for canal
        boats.&nbsp; The new marina is a private development rather than one
        belonging to British Waterways.&nbsp; Pictures marking progress will be
        posted below. </td>
