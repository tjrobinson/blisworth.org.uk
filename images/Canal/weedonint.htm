        The structure of each of the storehouses is
        based upon centrally placed doorways, on both the north and the south
        faces, which open into a hall <b>H</b> and stairwell.&nbsp; Doors off the hall at
        both the ground and the first floor lead to four large and identically
        sized rooms, 70 foot long by 38 foot wide with a ceiling at about 14
        foot, in each storehouse.&nbsp; The four storehouses to the south
        of the central canal, have also a basement, the south-facing windows of
        which are not visible in the inset
        because of a perimeter wall.&nbsp; Originally there were lifts, attached to prominent stone sills, placed
        outside the buildings but
        in the building visited there is an early 20th century
        electrically-operated lift installed in the hallway and this is believed
        to be the case in all the storehouses. A photograph of a lift is shown
        below. The upper hallway is very spacious, the doorway in the photo is
        the entrance of room &quot;<b>FW</b>&quot; as in the inset above.&nbsp; The stairs are off the picture to the
        right.</font><p align="center" style="padding-top: 0"><img border="0" src="central-lfts.jpg" width="600" height="442"><p align="left" style="padding-top: 0"><font color="#000080"> Originally, the upper
        rooms were to store 240000 stands of small arms plus ammunition while
        the lower rooms accommodated field artillery, ie. horse drawn gun

        based on memory and a few photographs.&nbsp; The scenes are described briefly in the captions

        history.&nbsp; There are also many documents and drawings at the <b>PRO</b>

        The drawing above is of a room located as is &quot;<b>GE</b>&quot; in
        the inset photograph above.&nbsp; This room was well-filled with small
        parts and pieces of fire-fighting equipment.&nbsp; A heavy sense of
        privacy radiated from one member of the museum staff and, as a
        consequence, one dares to show only a little of the contents. The floor is concrete but it is said
        it was once
        clad in narrow interlocking boarding 2&quot; thick.&nbsp; There are 12&quot;
        square columns of oak at regular intervals, some are not shown here, which support
        a network of heavy
        longitudinal beams with jointed cross joists.&nbsp; The floor above, in
        turn, rests on this network.&nbsp; From a reading of Williams's book it
        appears that the layout closely corresponds to that originally built.</font>

        The drawing above is of a room located as is &quot;<b>FW</b>&quot; in
        the inset photograph above.&nbsp; The room was totally empty.&nbsp; The floor is made of narrow
        interlocking boards set at an angle of 45 degrees to the axes of the
        building.&nbsp; The roof, which is hipped and pitched at ~35º, is supported with a
        complex network of heavy 3&quot; and 5&quot; L-form, ie. angle-iron, steel &quot;<i>Double
        W </i>&quot; trusses onto which are
        laid channel-form steel bearers.&nbsp; Only a suggestion of this network is depicted here.&nbsp;
        From the interior it appears that this roof network is boarded over the
        bearers with heavy planks upon which rests the weather-proofing and the
        slates.&nbsp; These heavy planks are set at 45º to the steel
        bearers (see the small section of roof behind the lift cage). The outermost joints of the trusses are
        deeply embedded in the walls so as to tie them.&nbsp; The end walls
        appear to be strengthened with heavy
        brick internal piers.&nbsp; From a reading of Williams's book it appears
        that the original roof was a 'double' with a central longitudinal valley that
        was supported by oak columns at first floor level.&nbsp; The roof trusses were then
        dual-arched, collared, with kingposts all in timber.&nbsp;
        The dating of the complete change to the roof, perhaps all the roofs, is
        not known but undoubtedly will be found in the Catalogue and notes
        held by the <b>WBHS</b>.&nbsp; Note that the present exterior form of
        the roofs are not identical.</font>
