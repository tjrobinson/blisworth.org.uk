        <p><font color="#000080">From the word 'Go' way back in 1845 with the
        opening of the branch line to Northampton and Peterborough coupled with
        the establishment of the first class station of the new site, Thomas
        Shaw of the Angel Hotel, Northampton and our local Richard Dunkley lost
        no time in formulating their plans to build a new Railway Posting Hotel
        and Pleasure Garden next to the station built by <a href="../Railway&#32;Arch/dunkley.htm"> Richard
        Dunkley</a>. Both
        men were already experienced in the new world of Railway needs,
        especially where money could be made. The Shaw family of the Northampton
        Hotel 'The Angel' in Bridge Street had already developed an important
        coaching service, so it was simply a case for them to switch their
        routes for their horse drawn vehicles to connect with the new Railway
        Stations. Likewise, Richard Dunkley, the Blisworth entrepreneur, had
        been heavily involved in the years prior to 1838 in railway work, and he
        leapt at all the opportunities of furthering his business.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">So it was with the new Station at Blisworth.
        Both men were primed for action. One factor in their favour was that
        they both had previously met and dealt with the land-owner George Henry
        the 4th Duke of Grafton who was a keen supporter of the <a href="../Rails.htm"> new level
        Station</a>, which being well served by new local Turnpikes offered the Duke
        a splendid service from his mansion at Wakefield Lawn, Potterpury to
        enable him to connect with trains running North and South as well as the
        new branch line to Peterborough. In those early days of travel the Duke
        could arrive at Blisworth by his own horse drawn carriage which was then
        lifted on to a railway flat top truck. So horse, carriage and owner
        could tirelessly arrive at London, unload, and drive about London in his
        own vehicle. There's nothing new in this mode of travel be it by cars or
        rail or crossing the Channel with your car on the ferry. The Duke of
        Grafton also kept a close watch on the standard of building of the
        Stable Block at the Hotel ... insisting on the highest standards. It was
        often said that horses had better accommodation than the labourers.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The lease for 79 years was accepted by Mr. Shaw
        and supported by the Directors of the Northampton Phipps Brewery who
        likewise had had good business relations with the Shaw family and the
        Angel Hotel. With the Hotel built by Mr. Dunkley the 3.25 acre garden
        site was tackled and laid out in terraces with a large central level
        area and liberally planted with trees and shrubs, many of which have
        survived to the present day.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Within a couple of years Blisworth Posting
        House Hotel and Railway Hotel and Pleasure Gardens became widely
        advertised. The Railway Company soon became involved too by putting on
        'Pleasure' trains from Northampton to Blisworth on weekdays ... but not
        on Sundays. Trains fares combined the charge for the Hotel Gardens as
        well as a discount on refreshments. First Class travel return tickets
        were one shilling (Old Money) and second Class six pence (Old Money).
        Music was provided by a seemingly endless supply of Brass Bands both
        Civil and Military. Stage Artists and general entertainers were already
        conducting tours by rail, much as our present day 'Pop Stars' do today.
        Pleasure Gardens were springing up in all cities and towns especially if
        served on or near to the growing Railway network. For instance stars
        from London's Vauxhall Gardens or Manchesters 'Belle Vue' duly arrived
        at Blisworth to give performances. In October 1849 a Mr. Creed arrived
        with his 'Royal Victoria' Balloon but rain stopped his first appearance.
        On the following week he made a successful ascent with two passengers.
        Travelling westward it got caught up with a 'raging wind' during which
        the balloon basket caught trees and fences. It made a safe descent in a
        field at the village of Tredington near to Shipton-on-Stour after a trip
        of 1 hr. 20 mins. Again in 1850 an even larger balloon arrived made with
        1,200 yards of silk and 120 feet in circumference, held 200,000 gallons
        of gas and, with the undercarriage attached, was 66 feet high. It was
        billed that a 'Living Animal' would be taken up attached to a parachute
        and duly launched over the Gardens. As no description of the animal was
        stated it leaves the reader to conjure up whether elephant or mouse was
        used.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The Gardens opened all day for this event.
        Special trains ran every half hour from Northampton. A Brass Band
        attended which played 'All Day'.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">As I have not located a record of the
        balloonists achievements I am unable to tell you whether the day was a
        success or not. Newspapers carried even larger adverts announcing that
        Thomas Shaw offered fun for all the family with refreshments at both the
        Hotel rooms or at the Station refreshment room which has also a Shaw
        sideline. Not only did folk arrive by train but Mr. Shaw's horse drawn
        omnibus plied to and from Towcester and the area. From the Hotel one
        could hire (self drive) post-chaises flys and saddle horses etc. One
        June day in 1858 'Mons Julliens' and his unrivalled band played in the
        Pavilion assisted by a choir of Damoiselles'. A troup of Chinese
        magicians turned up from the Royal Theatre at Drury Lane with their acts
        of 'Legerdemain' and 'Necromancy' etc. In 1862 the Great Blondin came
        bringing his 'High Rope' which was stretched across the centre lawn. (He
        had previously crossed the Niagara Falls). This same act was repeated by
        walking the 'high rope' then standing on his head, followed by wheeling
        a wheelbarrow with a man on his back. (He should have least have sat in
        the barrow).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Most of the special occasions were followed by
        spectacular Firework Displays and music.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Northampton Floral and Horticultural Society
        held their shows at the extensive and beautiful Hotel gardens. Picnics
        and food were arranged and the trees were hung with thousands of glass
        candle lamps in various colours. But still NO Sunday opening.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Parties came in even greater numbers; Sunday
        School Outings: Workhouse Inmates: came on their Annual Outings.
        Temperance Unions held their Grand Fetes enlivened by their own Brass
        Bands and large quantity of TEA. Not only was the Hotel fully used by
        the public but the Shaw Family somehow squeezed into the remaining
        spaces. At the 1861 census there was Thomas Shaw aged 54 and his wife
        52; their seven children were Anne 22; Charlotte 20; Thomas Jnr. 19;
        Emily 15; John 14; Richard 12; Elizabeth 9; and a second cousin 28.
        Resident Staff was a cook 51; Housemaid 18; Kitchen Maid 19; Waitress
        21; Barmaids three 21, 28 and 19 respectively. One Hostler 25 years and
        the most important 'Boots' aged 16 years. I am quite sure that the Staff
        was doubled by day workers needed to attend to the stabling ... and the
        gardens, they presumably would have been locals. By 1866 Thomas Shaw
        'Called it a day' and he appointed a Manager. He made the following
        statement to the local papers. 'I tender with grateful thanks to the
        nobility, Gentry and general public for their kind and flattering
        patronage afforded me during the many years I have occupied Blisworth
        Hotel and Gardens. I have appointed a Miss Whiteman as Manager, late of
        the Midland Hotel at Derby.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The Shaws continued to hold both the Angel
        Hotel at Northampton and Blisworth under the watchful eye of Mrs. Shaw
        and Managers. Mr. T. Shaw died in 1874.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">It is recorded that he was one of the largest
        and most extensive coach proprietors in England ... no one kept better
        horses. He saw railways arrive, which killed off many rival coaching
        companies, but T. Shaw by moving into the greater Hotel trade made a
        success. He was a keen cricketer and as a dying Christian he thanked God
        for the many mercies he had received. I would assume that he was buried
        at the Northampton Church of St Giles as was his Father. The Blisworth
        Hotel Shaws did however, have a connection with our Village Church for
        three of his daughters were married from it ... Anne, Emily and
        Elizabeth and a son Thomas.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">There is also an interesting local connection;
        on June 19th, 1952 John Camberlain aged 23 married Iris Sheila Stratton,
        daugther of <a href="../People.htm#eva">Eva Stratton</a>, at Blisworth Church, the Rector was the Rev. P. K. Challen. Sheila with
        her parents lived at 'Jasmine Cottage', High Street, and Northampton.
        John, however, is a great grandson of the said Thomas Shaw of Blisworth
        Hotel.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Mr G. de Wilde (1830-1870), editor for 40 years
        of the Northampton Mercury wrote the following:- 'To write of Blisworth
        and to say nothing about Blisworth Gardens be almost like playing Hamlet
        and leaving out the character of the Prince of Denmark'. He goes on to
        mention the charming grounds, brilliant with flowers and refreshed with
        greenest turf and shady bowers, but a pleasanter place to saunter in
        with a book at noon-day, or when you desire - 'a nest for evening
        weariness'. He also mentioned the twinkling lights in the shrubberies
        and the lingering sound of music with ladies' laughter coming through
        the shade'. I must not let such romantic visions cloud my brain so I
        will 1 press on with the story of the Hotel and Gardens.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">After the death of Thomas Shaw the management
        was handled by his widow up to 1879. The new proprietor was Charles
        Parker who found the establishment a little run down - incidentally this
        was the first change of owner since the inception of both Hotel and
        Gardens in 1847. Mr Parker was quick to make extensive alterations
        especially to the Pleasure Gardens. He built a covered orchestra
        pavilion to accommodate 100 performers and a new Concert Hall for indoor
        entertainments and a new roller skating rink of 700 sq. yds. Additional
        refreshment bars and tea arbours were erected as well as an open air
        stage and he continued to run the refreshment rooms on the Station
        Platform, charges at which were higher than in the Hotel Gardens - to
        this complaint he blamed the rentage charged by the Railway Company. On
        completion of the improvements he widely advertised claiming that the
        Hotel and Gardens were the most accommodating and central place of
        Public Resort in the Midlands. The Grand re-opening Fete and Gala was
        billed for Saturday 6th October, 1879 and on the following Monday (still
        seemingly never on a Sunday). BUT IT RAINED BOTH DAYS. He boldly claimed
        that he could give 3000 persons in various rooms and pavilions good
        entertainment - AND ONLY ONE MINUTE FROM THE STATION. Poor Charles
        Parker didn't live long enough to enjoy the fruits of his labours for by
        1881 his widow took charge until 1890 when she gave up the Hotel.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Then followed a Robert A Ashby whose name
        appears in the local trade directories from 1890 to 1898, by which time
        he would have read of the new form of transport i.e. the internal
        combustion contraption called the motor carriage which was to gradually
        oust the horse from our roads.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><img height="205" src="pavilion.jpg" width="313" align="left">
        By 1899 yet another proprietor appears - this
        time a 45 year old widower named Os. Cooke Wareing who in the same year
        married a 41 year old Patty Darley whose father was a House Steward and
        the Bridegrooms father was a builder - altogether a useful combination
        of in-laws. The Gardens flourished and were used for a great variety of
        celebrations. The inset picture is of the &quot;Fancy Bazaar&quot; which
        was created around 1900 but there's no-one who can recall where it
        was!&nbsp; The formation of a branch line Westward from Blisworth
        Station in 1866 had opened up a large new catchment area with easy
        access to the Blisworth Hotel. Blisworth folk made good use of the Hotel
        and grounds for their Fetes and money raising stunts. For the non
        walkers the farmers provided the wagons to get the people there. I
        recently found a programme card issued for a 'QUADRILLE PARTY' held at
        the Hotel on 13th March 1894 - It is certainly totally different from
        our modern discos!! The decorated programme card is lined with printed
        dance titles against each line a space provided for the holder of the
        card to obtain the names of partners she would wish to dance with thus
        filling the evenings programme. The date of the programme is 13th March
        1894 and I give you some of the dances :</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">'Polka-Waltz; Quadrille; Mazurka; Lancers;
        Princes Quadrille; Shottische; Caledonian Waltz; Cotillion; with the
        grand finale Waltz Gallop. I must say that I think that I have seen the
        lot, for in my youthful days it was 'May I have the pleasure' when
        approaching a likely partner.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Following Mr Wareing 1899-1908 there appeared a
        Mr &amp; Mrs Edward Francis Tresham whose name lingers on in the
        memories of numerous village elders including myself. The Tresham
        parents had two children; a girl named Nora and a boy named Guy, a
        somewhat fitting name for the family stemmed from the celebrated
        Northamptonshire family one of whose members Sir Francis Tresham, had
        been one of the conspirators with Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot. In
        keeping with the past Hotel proprietors who in turn had witnessed early
        balloonists, steam railways, cars, motor cycles and cycles. It was the
        good fortune of the Treshams to see their first flying machine. It so
        happened that a pilot - Claud Graham White had entered his flying
        machine, a Farman Bi-Plane in a race from London to Manchester. The
        other competitor was a Frenchman named Mssr Paulan. Starting late in the
        day Graham White was forced to land as night approached at Roade where
        he stayed at Dr. Ryans house - it is said that the local farmer in who's
        field Mr. White had landed padlocked the gate and going over to the
        intrepid pilot said &quot;Now Sir, you got in without permission but
        I'll see you don't get out for I've locked the gate&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Hundreds of people made their way to Roade to
        see this early aircraft including the Tresham family from the Hotel.
        Many folk landing vigil all night in order to see the departure next
        morning. The Frenchman had landed in Lichfield for the night well ahead
        of Mr White. Graham White however, decided to take off at 2.50 am the
        next morning in the dark, a feat never before attempted in Europe.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">(Sadly the Frenchman was informed of this
        manoeuvre so he too made an early start). At Roade cars ringed the field
        with their car head lights on, and not without qualms amongst the
        onlookers the aircraft rose and sailed away into the night - sadly again
        the engine later developed trouble and a second landing was made. Thus
        Mssr. Paulhan the Frenchman arrived at Manchester to win the £10,000
        prize at 44 mph average speed. A spectator commented;-&quot;Twas a curious
        thing said Oones to me, relieving his mind of a load - that the French
        machine in the famous race - was forced to go by Road(e)&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">And so back to the Blisworth Hotel and the
        Treshams during their period 1908-1926. During the World War I years,
        German prisoners were off loaded from the railway at Blisworth and
        marshalled in the station yard fronting the Hotel, then marched to the
        'Prisoner of War Camp' at nearby Eastcote. The prisoners reception
        guards used to arrive in good time so that they could enjoy their 'pintas'
        at the Hotel Bar - there were numerous incidents on these occasions. I
        well remember seeing the prisoners.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Following the 1914-18 war other entertainment
        centres were attracting pleasure seeking folk. Franklin's Gardens in
        Northampton became a new centre for Northamptonians - their attractions
        followed much the same pattern as the Hotel had done last century such
        as balloonists and pageants; the Blisworth Hotel lawn was turned into
        Tennis Courts. Regular dances were held in the Ballroom; Wedding parties
        were well catered for etc. The 79 year lease expired in 1926. Although
        some previous occupiers called themselves proprietors, they were in fact
        managers . Foreseeing changes ahead of ownership, probably caused Mr
        Tresham to call it a day - after 18 years at Blisworth; he retired and
        moved to Duston.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Also in the year 1926 the 79 year old lease
        held by Phipps Brewery of Northampton had expired.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The next recorded license was MR CHRISTOPHER
        FINNEGAN. He made a small contribution to the history of the Hotel by
        being the first Blisworth Hotelier to have a telephone installed, his
        local exchange number was 16. Mr Finnegan stepped out of the Hotel in
        1929 when a Mr G.H Roberts comes into the picture for a short period. By
        March 1932 the Hotel and Gardens were bought by Major Steedman. Many
        changes were made by him including the construction of a splendid
        swimming pool which was fed from a natural water course running through
        the gardens, there were 75 changing cubicles, a children's paddling
        pool, and a high and spring diving board, as well as a water slide, this
        local innovation attracted a lot of people from a wide area, transport
        via the new family cars brought in the crowds. After four years Major
        Speedman sold out to a Mr G.W.Hodges in 1936, who in a quick turn-around
        sold the Hotel and gardens 'lock, stock and bathing pool' to Miss
        Marjorie Somers in 1939. In November 1944 there was another change of
        ownership to Messre. Gensalve Ltd, the licensee Manageress could have
        been a Mrs Maude V. Godier, of these facts I am not quite clear. Then in
        quick time three changes of ownership followed one after the other -
        from the Magistrates licensing list the following names are recorded:-
        January 1946 - Gertrude V Curry; April 1946 - Alfred F Charlton;
        followed by Richard C.N. Woodhouse in 1947. During the war years plus
        the Hotel attracted a large following from the American Air-force bases,
        especially those from the Oxford direction. It was voiced that the
        Whisky supply was endless, so seemingly was the American money. By March
        1948 a new owner took over whose name was Sir Francis Leyland-Barratt
        who installed as his manager/licencee - John Henry Eaton-Hall; both men
        were ex-Life Guardsmen who had served in the forces together. John was a
        very popular 'Landlord'. In February 1949 he married a Miss Eleanor
        Morgan whose father was the licensee of the ancient Talbot Hotel at
        Towcester. All things looked set for a long run and it was hoped that Mr
        and Mrs J Eaton-Hall would make the Hotel their home for many years ...
        but it was not to be. On 6th October 1955 the Hotel &amp; Gardens were
        put up for sale by auction in London without reserve; the report also
        stated that the furniture and contents would be sold in November
        (surmising that the Hotel would be sold).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">BUT THERE WASN'T A SINGLE BID MADE FOR THE
        HOTEL!!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">It was thought that a caravan firm was
        interested in the site attached to the hotel.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Dancers circulating on the ballroom floor on
        the night of 18th November 1955, thought that it would be their last
        night - and on the following Monday the locals were to have had their
        last pint with the landlord. The auction sale of the whole contents of
        the Hotel had been advertised - beer engines and the lot, including
        garden seats which carried a plaque saying that they came from Lady
        Leyland-Barratts Walk, presumably the Barratts property from their
        former home. 'But hold on' - News soon spread around that the buyers for
        the whole of the hotel and gardens had turned up, and subject to the
        exchange of contracts, it had been sold as a going concern. 'Hurrah said
        the locals' - change of ownership took place on Tuesday 13th December
        1955. Outgoing Mr &amp; Mrs J.H. Eaton-Hall moved down to Newmarket
        where they took over a Hotel in the High Street. The new owners were Mr
        Harold Faithful of New Bradwell and Mr Horace Green of Bletchley,
        neither having any experience in the hotel line, seemingly appointed a
        manager whose name could have been Thompson. By this time caravans had
        appeared in the Hotel grounds, many belonging to the engineers and
        workers employed in the construction of the Northamptonshire stretch of
        the new M1 Motorway which was opened on the 2nd November 1959.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">By May 1960 the two Buckinghamshire businessmen
        pulled out of their hotel venture, and on the 8th June the establishment
        was again on the market - at the Auction the highest bid was £4,000,
        £1,000 short of the reserve price even though a lot of interest had
        been shown by some of the 50 people present in the hotel's ballroom at
        Blisworth. The outgoing owners had named the restaurant 'The Hunters
        Moon'. Once again the hotel was sold privately to a Mr R.G. Archer of
        Hockcliffe, the price was not revealed. Mr Archer said that he would run
        the premises as a Hotel with mid-week dances and at week-ends commencing
        8th July 1960. The next names that appear on the scene were Mr Frank
        Topham and his father John, they represented a family syndicate calling
        themselves Topham Estates, they had bought both Hotel and gardens. In
        1963 a young Alan Mathews arrived at Blisworth Gardens from London,
        together with his wife. Alan's job was to assist Frank Topham in the
        development and running the then established Caravan Park.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Seemingly Mr Topham realised that land surface
        was worth more than water so the swimming pool which became rather tatty
        was filled in, and the area was concreted for a car park. Later Mr
        Topham sold away the Hotel but retained the gardens, and Alan.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">With the development of the new and larger
        Caravans so the Park developed on more permanent lines - individuals
        creating splended pocket gardens around their homes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The Topham syndicate sold the Park in 1969 to a
        Charles Simpson Organisation, Alan continues as Manager and under his
        direction the whole Park is being transformed into a splendid
        Residential area of permanent dwellings starting at £30,000 to
        £65,000.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">I now come to the last chapter which takes us
        up to the present year 1988. Following the Topham sale of the Hotel the
        next name I have is Mr P.H Vanderveldon and partner Mr. Ernest Huff. By
        Febuary 1974 Mr Dino Charalambous buys the Hotel on a 40 year lease.
        Later in 1974 Mr J.R Yates became the Licencees. In May 1978 Mr C.E
        Bentham appears and with him a partner Mr N.S Fookes. By June 1982 and
        1983 Mr Fookes stays on but two different partners names appear; July
        1985 - the tenant Licensee was a Mr D. Horrix, changing again in Febuary
        1986 to a Mr J. Reissman. Finally, to date, Mr David Unwin with partner
        Mr John Everett took over on 1st May, 1987 followed by a splendid
        opening celebration on Tuesday 19th May, 1987 and... no longer using the
        name 'Blisworth Hotel' it becomes 'Beadles of Blisworth.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">By the way, as I have only mentioned names
        taken from the Magistrates list of Licensees I haven't mentioned wives
        and families who likewise came to Blisworth Hotel and in many cases
        shared in schooling and other village activities, plus of course the
        need for a feminine hand in the Hotels running.</font></p>
