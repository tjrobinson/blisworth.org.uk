he drove the steam dredger based at Gayton, which through various vicissitudes
has ended up unloved and uncared for at Ellesmere Port Museum. The steam
dredger, see below, ceased to be used by BW after 1963/4 and Craney then went to

The forming of an overflow weir south of Candle bridge was a relatively large
project which was outsourced by B.W. whereas in G.U.C.C. days it might well have
been designed and built by local staff.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On completion of the weir, the small overflow to the north
of the bridge which had allowed water to pass beyond Candle Cottage was closed
(but not actually infilled until 1991 when heavy flooding brought incomplete
works to B.W's attention). The ground paddle adjacent to the weir
is now little used as the weir maintains the required water level.</p>

erosion increased with the use of powered craft.&nbsp; Similarly, animals
