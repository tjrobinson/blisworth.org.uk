&amp; HIRECRAFT COME OF AGE</font></span></b></p>

<p>From around 1950 British Waterways started their pleasure boat operations and
by the mid 50’s there were three classes of boat operating the two berth Water
Baby range seen here.&nbsp; The middle of the range were the hire cruisers
converted from redundant carrying boats and again some were based at Gayton
Yard.</p>

Similarly in the mid 50’s the privately operated <b>Nancy</b> and <b>Nelson</b>
regularly visited Blisworth and were among the converted trading boats used as
mobile floating hotels.&nbsp; <b>Nancy</b> had been built in 1928 by Walkers of
Rickmansworth as a horse boat converted to motorised in 1936 and bought by
Michael Streat in 1952 and converted to a hotel boat in 1954.&nbsp; <b>Nelson</b>
was built in 1923 at Nursers yard at Braunston and originally named <b>Blue Lias</b>
when purchased by S.E. Barlow in 1935 she was renamed Nelson and acquired by M.
Streat in 1952 to be used as a hotel boat.&nbsp; Both were eventually broken up
.(Thanks to P Harrison for the historical detail.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Trip boats have now become a regular feature of the
waterway scene frequently being purpose built, see Taurus and Snipe above, but
in the early days boats were converted for passenger carrying.&nbsp; <b>Enterprise</b>
was such a boat as after a chequered career pictured here at Braunston in 1958
at the time of its conversion.&nbsp; She was originally built as an iron horse
boat at Fellows, Morton and Clayton Ltd<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Saltley
Dock in 1903 and named <b>Kimberley</b>, converted to a motor during 1938 at
Yarwoods shipyard on the River Weaver, passing to British Waterways in 1949 and
sold to Charles Ballinger in 1953, renamed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><b>Susan</b> and joined a small fleet of boats servicing Cadbury<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>factories.&nbsp; In 1957 the boat was sold to a Ram
Meinertzhagen, renamed <b>Enterprise</b> and taken to the Willow Wren dock at
Braunston where it was converted to a trip boat, with structure and engine
changes, the cabin being rebuilt so she could pass under the Bridge St. bridge
on the Kennet in Reading.&nbsp; This bridge had been reinforced in 1943 with
steel girders to take D Day traffic and the headroom was only 4ft 6ins. On its
passage through it had to be loaded with ten tons of breeze<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>blocks so as to pass under the bridge. The use of this boat on a regular
basis was a contributory factor in stopping the Ministry of Transport<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>applying to abandon the Kennet. Other carriers from 1950 onwards had also
moved cargoes on the Kennet and Avon canal to keep it open and eventually made
available for complete refurbishment and cruising throughout its entire length.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Spring of 1961 our local entrepreneur David Blagrove
agreed with two partners to purchase the boat for local operations but in 1964
it was again sold on this time to Jim Marshall who operated her until 1966 and
passed the boat to Robin Hewett at Braunston who operated her as a camping boat
until his demise in 1966, eventually sold and now believed to be fully converted
and located on the Oxford Canal.<o:p>
