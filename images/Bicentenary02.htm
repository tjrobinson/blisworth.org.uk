        and it was
        necessary for the original canal company to negotiate with the Duke the
        route of the canal and tunnel.&nbsp; The fellow slightly to the left is

        <p align="left">A nine or ten piece band played classical music for
        the enjoyment of onlookers - they kept it up for while after
        disappearing into the tunnel with the result that they created some curious acoustic effects.
        <p align="left">The Barlow butty, <b>Raymond</b>, has the unfortunate
        distinction of being the last wooden narrow boat to be constructed at
        Braunston and was launched on the 2nd June1958.&nbsp;&nbsp; Used on the coal contract
        until Barlows ceased to carry by canal, the fleet was taken over by
        Michael Streat who had been operating pleasure craft out of an adjacent
        building in the boatyard since 1952.<br>
        The new carrying company was called Blue Line Canal Carriers Ltd., and
        the early boats carried, as part of their decoration, a ships wheel on
        an obvious blue background as well as all the usual decoration.&nbsp;
        The wheel was later discontinued.&nbsp; When commercial carrying
        virtually ceased in 1970 the last boat captain continued to live on the
        butty Raymond on the main line at Braunston, after his death the boat
        eventually came into the ownership of the charity &quot;The<br>
        Friends of Raymond&quot; who returned it to its original Barlow livery
        and it is now based at Braunston marina.<br>

        <p align="center">At the turn before the mill, going north, this is the famous &quot;President&quot; steam-powered narrow
        boat which spends much of its time exploring the canal system, to the
        great pleasure of enthusiasts.&nbsp; It is maintained by donations and
        some dedicated practical people.</td>

        <p align="center">Along with the canal-side and village celebrations
        there were held a few showings of Richard Conlon's play, which&nbsp; he
        both wrote and produced, entitled &quot;Echoes&quot;.&nbsp; It was a
        lyrical recall of George Freeston, our late village historian.&nbsp; The
        mystical finale, pictured here in rehearsal, saw the character of George
        contemplating what may lie among the secrets of the tunnel.</p>
        <p align="center">The play was organized by the Blisworth Heritage
        Society as part of a community project.&nbsp; The Chapel room was packed
        for each showing - unfortunately many villagers said they were not successful in
        seeing it or, perhaps more likely, had spent too much of their time in a
        siesta encouraged by the Mediterranean weather.</p>
        <p align="center">That's all - the photographers thank you for your
        attention and hope you enjoyed the show.</p>
        <p align="center">In December the Community Play &quot;ECHOES&quot; was
        presented from a DVD which had been compiled by R Henessy from his own
        'footage' and that of G Digby.</p>

        <p>The year of the Bicentenary was rounded off by the planting by the
        Blisworth Heritage Society of an oak tree on the canal bank opposite Westley Mill
        to commemorate the bicentenary.&nbsp; A mulberry tree was planted at Stoke Bruerne; both these
        trees funded out of the proceeds of the entertainments laid on by both
        villages in June.</p>
