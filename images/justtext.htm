            The motor is <i> Arcturus</i> which was built by Walker

            Prototype Star Class for the Grand Union Canal Carrying Company
            Limited. It was registered at Rickmansworth to comply with the Canal
            Boat Act 1877 and was allocated the number 28. Later it was gauged
            with the number GU12356.<br>
            <i>Arcturus</i> was sold in 1942 to A Wander Ltd (Ovaltine) of Kings
            Langley joining their coal carrying fleet. In 1952 the fleet was
            sold and <i> Arcturus</i> went to the Midlands.<br>
            In 1957 she was bought by Phoenix Canal Carrying to take coal to the
            Royal Worcester porcelain works from Anglesey Basin and in 1958 she
            was bought by Bryan Nicoll.<br>
            The boat was returned to Walker Brothers at Rickmansworth for repair
            and conversion to a passenger carrying boat, initially on the Wey
            and subsequently on the Grand Union at Watford. At the end of 1999

            mainly used to carry coal from the Midlands to
            London. Towed first by motor <i> Roger</i> and then by <i>Nutfield</i>. Throughout
            their working life they were operated by Arthur and Rose Bray and
            her son Ernie Kendal. One of the more famous jobs was carrying coal
            from Atherstone to the Kearley &amp; Tonge jam factory at Southall,
            known as the &quot;Jam 'Ole Run&quot;. Trade ceased in 1970 but the
            Brays continued to live aboard until, in 1980, they sold <i> Raymond</i> to
            Jim Doris Collins who lived aboard until 1993.&nbsp; In 1996, <i>
            Raymond</i> was acquired by the &quot;Friends of Raymond&quot; who
            carried out restoration.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br><i>Nutfield</i> was built by Yarwoods for the Grand Union
            Canal Carrying Co. and launched on 18th August 1936.&nbsp; Her
            engine was a water cooled National DM2 no. 46644, coupled to a
            Brunton gearbox, no. E/7976/1.&nbsp; The original Yarwoods riveted
            cabins were not popular with crews, mainly because they were damp
            due to condensation as a result of poor insulation and the vast
            majority were replaced with wooden ones.&nbsp; Blue Line fitted a
            brand new Lister HB2 before the boat entered traffic with them,
            which is what she has now.&nbsp; She is remarkably unaltered from
            her final working form.&nbsp; In 1968 <i> Nutfield</i> took over the task of
            towing <i> Raymond</i> which had previously been done by <i>Roger</i>. The once
            prosperous carrying trade had already dwindled due to competition by
            road (the railway at Braunston had already come and gone!). Now just
            two pairs plus a single motor were carrying coal from Atherstone to
            the Kearley &amp; Tonge jam factory at Southall. In October 1970
            they arrived with a load and were told that it would be the last -
            it was the last &quot;Jam 'Ole Run&quot;. &amp;nbsp<i>Nutfield</i>
            (like <i>Raymond</i>) was sold off by Blue Line. <i> Nutfield</i> was purchased by
            the &quot;Friends of Raymond&quot; in 2003 and restored.</font>

          <font SIZE="-1">One of two wooden ice boats built in 1911 for the
          Coventry Canal Company. Converted to a powered craft in the mid 1950s
          and had a counter fitted in 1958 at Charity Dock. In 1971 suffered a
          gas explosion and sank. She was rescued and restored. Bought by
          present owners in 1999 again in need of major
          restoration which is ongoing. She is now powered by a 1937 Bolinder
          LDW engine.</font>

            <font SIZE="-1">A
            Star Class Small Woolwich built by Harland &amp; Wolff in North
            Woolwich on the River Thames in 1935. Named after a star in the
            constellation of Leo. She was registered to the Grand Union Canal
            Carrying Company as fleet number 35. Taken out of carrying service
            in 1955 she was converted to a &quot;Zoo Bus&quot; and renamed <i> Water
            Fairy</i>. In 1965 she was bought by Oliver Lovell who filled in her
            sides and renamed her <i>Romulus</i>. She was then run as an
            educational/camping boat until 1985 when she was bought by her
            present owner who de-converted her and gave her back
            her original name of <i> Denebola</i>. She is still
            composite with steel sides and elm bottom and is powered by her
            original National DM2 engine. The boatman's cabin is decorated with
            Ron Hough roses and castles and still contains the original coal
            bucket with the fleet number stamped on it.</font>

          with an iron hull with part steel bottom. In 1988 it was converted to
          look like a replica Bridgewater Canal Tunnel Tug. It is currently coal
          fired and steam powered by a Cochrane &amp; Co 15HP Compound engine
          dating to about 1895. It has a Vertical Fire Tube Boiler rebuilt in
          1996.</font>

          <font SIZE="-1">Built
          in 1946 by Yarwoods for Fellows Morton &amp; Clayton and was 
          the last motor to be built for them. She subsequently went to work in
          the British Transport fleet as No 359. She thereafter was re-allocated
          to the South Eastern Division and was based at Uxbridge as No 601. As
          the canals went into decline she was cut in half and the stern section
          was dumped at Slough. She subsequently had a new but much shorter bow
          fitted and was used by British Waterways Board as a tug/icebreaker.
          She
          was sold to the Warwickshire Flyboat Company and was bought by her
          present owner in 1986.</font><br>
