        <p align="left"><b>35-00</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The map shows the southwestern
        edge of Blisworth with the Grand Junction Canal (GJC) passing under West
        Bridge.&nbsp; The north portal of the tunnel is a quarter mile to the
        south.&nbsp; At a time when both stretches of the canal were completed
        between Birmingham and London, with only the Blisworth Tunnel to finish,
        Benjamin Outram was contracted to build a tramway (as we now call it) which joined the two
        halves over Blisworth Hill.&nbsp; The tramway was in service for five
        years between 1800 and 1805.&nbsp; Outram had already built tramways
        elsewhere in England and this one appears to be of a very similar
        design.&nbsp; Wooden wagons with cast iron wheels and axles were drawn
        by teams of horses - steam engines which were mobile (ie. locomotives)
        were only just being invented by Trevithick at about the time.<p align="left">The
        red line shows the path that the tramway, or perhaps more appropriately the plateway,
        took running south from <a href="West&#32;Bridge/west-end.htm">Pickford's
        wharf </a> at Blisworth.&nbsp; It was
        originally laid from a point to the south of the turnpike bridge but was
        extended to the larger wharf area to the north a few months later. Generally
        the path was made up of hardcore over a width of about 6 yards and two sets of
        &quot;rails&quot; were place side by side.&nbsp; In the area covered by
        this map there seems to be a profile which could accommodate only one
        set of &quot;rails&quot; and in the region indicated by the
        &quot;X&quot; even a single width seems challenged by the eroding
        embankment against the canal.&nbsp; This fact seems to suggest earth
        movements after the plateway was taken up and a possible reason is
        offered at the end of the article on this website dealing with the <a href="Tunnel&#32;Story/Tunnel-Story.htm">
        tunnel construction</a>.<p align="left">The line of the plateway over
        the hill covers a distance of well over three miles in a series of reasonably
        straight sections.&nbsp; It extended as far as Stoke Bruerne bottom
        lock.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/1820/southfields.htm">See map</a> for its position
        shown by a pink line.<br>
        As required by the enabling
        Act of 1793, Outram's workers were expected to build the plateway
        directly over the straight line of the tunnel beneath - or as close as
        practicable. &nbsp; It appears that unfortunately this
        ideal was compromised and sections of the plateway are
        built over at least two intended alignments of the tunnel.&nbsp;A
        reasonable conjecture is that, as one tunnel alignment was abandoned
        for another, the railway team adopted a new line for only what was yet
        to be built.
        <p align="left"><b>35-01</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This c. 1965 picture shows a
        field boundary on Tunnel Hill Farm which crossed the band of hardcore bedding for
        the plateway.&nbsp; The hedge never thrived on the hardcore and so a gap
        is left. </p>

        plate end was thickened with a &quot;D&quot; shaped boss of cast iron
        which would bed into the stone, thus promoting stability.&nbsp; The
        design is referred as a foot-mounted plate.&nbsp; The plates were in fact made as a single casting,
        including bosses at each end and included the upright section to one
        side.&nbsp; This picture more clearly shows the L-shaped cross-section
        of the plates.&nbsp; The upright sections were
        placed on the inside of the line intended for the wheels and prevented
        the wagons from running off the plates.&nbsp; Important advantages of
        this design were that the casting process for the plates was simple and
        the wagons could be run off the ends of the track and turned and
        manipulated on their wheels on the wharf hard-standing.<p>The upright sections were placed on the inside of the wheels so that
        a bed of gravel could be laid between them for the horses to walk
        on.&nbsp; The wheels usually possessed a narrow flat tread (see <b>35-11</b>
        below) so that any stones lying in the path of the wheels would
        be crushed or pushed out of the way.</p>
