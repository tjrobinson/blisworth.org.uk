        several of my uncles did but I was one of numerous enthusiasts who were
        privileged to enter signal boxes throughout Britain and allowed to work
        under the strict supervision of the signalman. My time in the Blisworth
        box was mainly with Jack Morrisroe who’s referred to elsewhere in
        ‘Blisworth Images’.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Blisworth Station box was a Class 1 box, the
        highest grade. It had 75 levers and was one of the largest on the LMS
        system to be manned by only one signalman plus a booking clerk. The
        levers most used were the ones at each end, numbers 1,2,3,4 and 5 for up
        (towards London) main line trains and 73,74 and 75 for down (from
        London) trains. The main line to and from London Euston was one of the
        busiest in Britain and still is as although the network’s been
        curtailed, train frequencies have increased. In the 1950s you might have
        about six trains a day from Euston to Birmingham – now there’s one
        about every 20 minutes.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Destinations then as now included Birmingham and
        Wolverhampton, Liverpool, Manchester, North Wales, the Lake District and
        Scotland. Many trains had names, the most well-known being the ‘Royal
        Scot’ (10 a.m. from Euston and also from Glasgow Central). But there
        was also ‘The Midlander’ (Birmingham and Wolverhampton), ‘The
        Irish Mail’ (twice a day to Holyhead), ‘The Welshman’ (Llandudno,
        Bangor, Portmadoc and Pwllheli), ‘The Manxman’ and ‘The Merseyside
        Express’ (Liverpool Lime Street), ‘The Comet’ and ‘The Mancunian
        (Manchester London Road), ‘The Ulster Express’ (Heysham for the
        Belfast Ferry), ‘The Northern Irishman’ (Stranraer for the Larne
        Ferry) ‘The Mid-Day Scot’ (Glasgow) and ‘The Royal Highlander’
        (7.15 p.m. Euston to Inverness). Most of these names are no more.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">There were also the up and down ‘Postals’ or
        TPO (Travelling Post Office) as they were officially known. These left
        Euston and Glasgow Central at 8.30 pm, consisted solely of mail vans
        with teams of post office sorters on board and picked up mail bags at
        speed periodically from line-side apparatus. The down ‘Postal’
        passed through Blisworth around 9.40 pm and the up one around 2.45 am.
        They were part of a national TPO network and the down train stopped at
        Tamworth interchanging mails there with the 7.20 pm Bristol to
        Newcastle. The up Postal was involved in the 1963 Great Train Robbery
        near Cheddington, Bucks.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">There were also boat trains for Liverpool
        Riverside and party specials known as ‘parspecs’, particularly from
        destinations such as Alsager, Congleton and Kidsgrove on the former
        North Staffordshire network and also from Lancashire towns such as
        Accrington, Burnley, Haslingden and Littleborough on the former
        Lancashire and Yorkshire network. On Cup Final days, especially if both
        teams came from within the LMS region, it was not unusual to have 15 or
        so specials heading for Wembley. On their return it was also not unusual
        to receive the occasional beer-bottle thrown from a train window!</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Weekly supplements to the working timetable were
        issued to drivers, signalmen and other key rail staff and gave details
        of all specials, temporary speed restrictions and other information
        which key staff needed to know.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Few people had cars in the 1950s and most went on
        holiday by train. So rail traffic was very busy, especially on Christmas
        Eve, Maundy Thursday and on summer weekends when most trains were
        ‘divided’, that is they ran in two or even three parts. Over 100
        trains during an eight-hour shift was commonplace and beyond Roade where
        the tracks doubled to four with the Northampton line there were, of
        course, far more. There were also parcel, freight, fish, milk and
        newspaper trains. Several parcel trains remarshalled at Blisworth during
        the night shift prior to continuing to destinations elsewhere. A
        notorious freight train was the up fish train from Fleetwood to London,
        passing Blisworth about 8 p.m. and nicknamed the ‘Ocean Roamers’.
        This train was fully-fitted with automatic braking and ran at express
        speed. The aroma in its wake gave an indication of its cargo.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">My knowledge of railway geography was enhanced by
        my time at Blisworth. I already knew of Bushbury, the engine sheds for
        Wolverhampton and of Bescot, the huge freight marshalling yard near
        there, of Edge Hill and Longsight, the engine sheds for Liverpool and
        Manchester respectively and of Polmadie, the engine sheds for Glasgow.
        But I soon became aware of places like Adswood, the Stockport
        marshalling yard from where a parcels train to London remarshalled at
        Blisworth on the night shift, of Kensington Olympia and of Addison Road
        which were parcel trains destinations and of Etruria to where a daily
        train load of ironstone left Blisworth at the ungodly hour of 2.08 a.m.
        and where I thought must be somewhere in Italy and wondered why it
        travelled north, until I discovered it was in Stoke-on-Trent! Shelton
        iron works have long been demolished and the site was landscaped into a
        Garden Festival site some years ago.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">It was necessary for signalmen at key locations to
        know the whereabouts of approaching trains, thus enabling them to
        determine if a freight or parcels train needed to be shunted into a
        loop, allowing a passenger or faster train to overtake it. There were
        loops adjacent to both main lines between Blisworth and Gayton and the
        start of the down loop can be seen in the foreground of photos <b> 27-08</b> and
        <b>27-08a</b>. Booking clerks at Tring and Bletchley telephoned us with passing
        times of down line trains and those at Nuneaton and Rugby did similarly
        for up line trains. One of the Blisworth booking clerk’s tasks was to
        record this information in a register and telephone his counterparts
        with information on trains passing Blisworth. The times of all trains
        entering and leaving the Blisworth section and passing the box were also
        recorded.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">All trains had numbers called reporting numbers;
        odd numbers were for down trains, evens for up. Although we knew all the
        regular numbers by heart, in busy times when trains might run out of
        normal sequence and also for ‘specials’ the numbers were boldly
        displayed on the engine boiler and were prefixed with a ‘W’ denoting
        ‘Western Division’ to distinguish them from ‘M’ for ‘Midland
        Division’ – the Midland main line to and from St. Pancras. This
        distinction was important at locations like Carlisle where the divisions
        merged. The down Royal Scot was number W65 and the up Royal Scot W96.
        The clerks would merely say ‘sixty-five, thirty-seven, Tring’ and
        this information was sufficient.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Few passenger trains stopped at Blisworth in the
        1950s. The ones I recall were the 8.45 a.m. Euston to Wolverhampton
        (stopping just before 10 a.m.), a 1.20 p.m. local from Bletchley to
        Rugby (around 2 p.m.), the 8.30 a.m. Carlisle to Euston (just before 3
        p.m.), the 6.57 p.m. local from Rugby to Bletchley (around 7.30 p.m. and
        the return working from the 1.20 p.m. down train) and the 5.05 pm
        Blackpool to Euston (just before 10 pm). The two-coach ‘Blisworth
        Motor’, referred to elsewhere, connected with each of these, from and
        to Northampton.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">In addition to the ‘Blisworth Motor’, a
        similar motor train made a daily weekday trip from Leamington (not
        Daventry as your caption to photo 27-49 suggests) to Northampton via
        Weedon. On arrival at Blisworth, just before 4 pm, it would proceed to
        the up main line just past the platform, stop, the signalman would
        adjust the points for the Northampton branch and the train would
        reverse, coach first to Northampton. The return journey left Northampton
        around 6.15 p.m., engine first, and at Blisworth, provided the main
        lines were clear, it would again proceed to the up main line just beyond
        the platform, stop, the signalman would change the points to allow a
        crossover to the down main line and the train would continue, coach
        first, to Leamington. The crossover from the up to the down main line is
        shown in the centre of photo 27-04.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">The 8.30 a.m. Carlisle train had reporting number
        W74 and was very popular with Blisworth and Northampton travellers,
        especially railway staff returning from holidays. It called at all major
        stations to Crewe and then only Blisworth and Bletchley before arriving
        at Euston around 4.20 p.m. and was usually hauled by one of the
        Coronation Class Pacifics, similar to the locomotive shown in photo
        27-08a. There were 38 locomotives in this class, all based at Camden,
        Crewe, Carlisle or Polmadie (Glasgow) and they easily handled 16-coach
        trains or heavier on the climbs over Shap and Beattock summits. Given a
        clear road and a keen train crew, arrival at Blisworth could be up to 15
        minutes early and having to wait for time no doubt annoyed travellers on
        the 12.40 p.m. express from Manchester which normally preceded the
        Carlisle train but would, in this situation, be held back by signals at
        Gayton.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Inside the Blisworth box, like all boxes, levers
        serving different purposes had different colours. Stop signal levers
        were painted red, distant signals were yellow, points were brown, point
        locks were black, unused levers were white. Levers for semaphore signals
        had long well-polished tops, essential if you needed to tug hard with
        perhaps half a mile of coiled wire to be pulled, but those controlling
        colour lights, the up Middleton intermediate block signal for example,
        had shorter tops to remind one not to over-pull. On a long shelf above
        the levers were the four ‘block instruments’ allowing telegraphic
        communication with adjacent boxes at Roade, Gayton (two instruments –
        one for the main line, one for the loops) and Rothersthorpe Crossing on
        the Northampton branch. Each instrument comprised two electronic needle
        indicators, the bottom one controlled by the Blisworth signalman, the
        top one controlled by the signalman in the other box. The device
        incorporated a gong and tapper used to communicate coded messages. Each
        gong had a different tone.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Having worked at the Gayton, Heyford and Banbury
        Lane boxes I was already familiar with the various bell codes. Express
        passenger trains were four consecutive beats; local passenger trains
        were 3 beats, pause, 1 beat (3:1); parcel trains were one beat, pause,
        three beats, pause, one beat (1:3:1); fully fitted freight trains were
        three beats, pause, one beat, pause, one beat (3:1:1) and so on. The
        philosophy was that a line was considered closed until proved to be open
        and the normal position of the needle indicator was vertical (line
        closed). When a train was offered and accepted, the receiving signalman
        would repeat the code and set his needle to ‘line clear’ which
        showed in the other box and allowed the signalman there to clear his
        signals. On entering your section, the other signalman sent a two beat
        signal (train entering section) and the receiving signalman changed his
        indicator to ‘train on line’. As trains passed, you sent a ‘train
        entering section’ code to the box in advance and when the train had
        passed complete with tail lamp you sent a ‘train out of section’
        code to the box in the rear and returned your indicator to the original
        line closed position. A further train could then be ‘offered’.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">On the up line towards London, all trains were
        offered by the Gayton signalman on the main line instrument. If the
        train needed diverting into the loop, the Blisworth signalman would
        accept on the loop instrument, thus authorising the Gayton man to set
        the points for the loop. The loop signal, set to danger, can be seen on
        the right of the cleared signals in photo 27-27. The Gayton signal box
        on the up side is behind the locomotive tender.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Wherever possible, boxes were situated on
        alternate sides of the line. Thus Blisworth and Banbury Lane boxes were
        positioned on the down side and Heyford and Gayton on the up. Rules
        required signalmen to observe passing trains for any irregularities and
        if, for example, a carriage door was seen to be open the train had to be
        stopped and the sections of line searched. Door interlocking on modern
        trains minimises this eventuality.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">A word about the ‘block’ system may be useful.
        In the early days of railways when signalling was primitive, time was
        considered an appropriate medium and if a train had passed, say, 15
        minutes earlier it was deemed safe to send another one. After several
        major accidents it was realised that space, not time, was a better
        interval and so lines were divided into sections, controlled by
        signalboxes or, on long sections, by intermediate signals (known as IBs).
        Normally there could only be one train in a section at a time and this
        was known as the ‘absolute’ block system. However, in order to
        facilitate freight movements, a variation known as ‘permissive’
        block existed whereby a freight train could be accepted on a goods line
        and into a section already occupied by another non-passenger train,
        provided the driver of the subsequent train was cautioned before
        entering and told of a train or trains in front. The block instruments
        controlling the loops at Blisworth and Gayton allowed this and
        incorporated an indicator showing a number and which allowed for
        occupation by up to seven trains although I never experienced more than
        two.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Several trains a day carrying chalk from the
        Dunstable area to the cement works at Southam on the Leamington branch
        passed through Blisworth. These and their return empties were regular
        occupants of the goods loops. The down trains were signalled as ordinary
        freight trains as far as Blisworth where the bell code was changed to
        ‘branch freight’, an indication to the Weedon signalman to divert
        the train to the Leamington branch.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><font color="#000080">Steam locomotives need water and troughs located
        at Castlethorpe and elsewhere on the system allowed for water to be
        picked up at high speed and using a scoop. In peak times when trains
        were running with tight headways it was common for the troughs not to
        have refilled sufficiently to allow the engine of a subsequent train to
        obtain water in this way and consequently the train would make an
        unscheduled stop at Blisworth to take on water. The water tower can be
        seen to the left of the signal box in photo 27-45 and it was an
        impressive sight to see one of the major expresses, perhaps hauled by a
        Coronation, Princess, Royal Scot or Jubilee class engine, stopping at
        Blisworth for this purpose. The task took 10 minutes or more to complete
        and a sea of heads invariably appeared from compartment windows along
        the train, no doubt wondering what was happening. As a result, a number
        of following trains were often delayed and all this had to be reported
        to the booking clerks down the line and to the train controller at
        Rugby.</font><font color="#000080"><o:p>
