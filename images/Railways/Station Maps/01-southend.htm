      <td width="929" height="126">The entire station layout at Blisworth is
        shown in a sequence of four sections.&nbsp; The date of the original
        map, which measures 0.8m by 2.7m and is drawn at a scale of 240:1, is
        unclear.&nbsp; It certainly shows much updating, it was a 'working' map,
        but also shows some old features such as the gate across Ford Lane on
        map 2.&nbsp; The SMJ cottages (1890) are shown on map 4 but there are
        numerous little diagrams of the signalling 'trees' and some of these
        might be dated at post-1923 when the regrouping of the railway companies
        took place.&nbsp; This map has fewer buildings (little huts etc.) on it
        than the <a href="../station.htm">heavily annotated map</a> that is also
        on this website - we are not certain of the dating of that map
        either.&nbsp; The map is the property of Andy Newbery, Blisworth.&nbsp;
        It may be offered to the NRO.&nbsp; All four maps have coloured and
        pencilled notes describing electrical installations.&nbsp; Some of the
        pencilled notes are hardly decipherable on the original.&nbsp; On a
        17&quot; screen, the scale of these maps is about 275:1.
        <p><b>MAP No. 1:</b>&nbsp; Of particular interest is the driveway
        leading to Ford Lane and the arrangements (incl. a carriage turntable)
        for off/on loading cattle.&nbsp; Access to some railway cottages and the
        Tank House are shown off this driveway.&nbsp; The plateman's hut is
        clearly shown by the bridge - it was possibly also used by the postal
        workers dealing with the mailbag ejector, but no access paths are shown
        leading to/from this hut.
