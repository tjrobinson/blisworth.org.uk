<p><font color="#000080">There's local sayings that extra crew would take a ride
on the loco footplate and be dropped off for a few hours in the cutting.  The driver of a
returning train would recognise the guy and take him back to Blisworth Station.  The exaggerated
version is that a crew member would have his shotgun on the loco and take potshots at rabbits from the moving train and stop
the train if he got one.&nbsp;<br>

One correspondent via this website replies, &quot;Listen!&nbsp; Those 'sayings' were supposed to have
been secret - and they were very, very true.&nbsp; As a lad, waiting for my call-up to go into the army, I was often
threatened with a thick ear if ever I 'opened my gob and spilled the beans'.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And yes, if we had to work a Saturday shift my old driver Bert always took along his 410 shotgun which he secreted under his
coat.&nbsp; On one occasion this practice impaired his getting up onto the footplate
and he fell backwards onto the ground.&nbsp; The loaded shotgun discharged itself, tearing
a chunk out of his boot.&nbsp; Luckily, he survived without actual injury to himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Old Bert was made of sterner stuff - you couldn't imagine him being killed off like
that!&quot;</font></p>
