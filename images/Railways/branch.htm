        <p><font color="#000080">This Branch Railway which connects Peterborough
        with the main London and Birmingham Line at Blisworth is forty-seven and
        a quarter miles in length, and was opened to the public on Monday, the
        second of June, 1845, when several of the Directors, accompanied by the
        Mayor, Corporation, gentry, and other inhabitants of Northampton,
        journeyed in a train of fifteen first-class carriages from Northampton
        to Peterborough in two and a half hours, including stoppages of about
        fifty minutes, every prominent view of the line throughout its whole
        length being occupied by the astonished and wonder-stricken natives,
        &quot;Whatever prospective advantages this Railway might possess upon
        its formation, the results of the first years traffic have very far
        exceeded the most sanguine expectations of its promoters; at the same
        time it has afforded to the inhabitants of the eastern part of the
        county, and others residing at and near the towns of Stamford, Market-Deeping,
        Spalding, Boston, Holbeach, Long-Sutton and Wisbeach, a facility of
        transit for themselves and goods to the metropolis and to the more
        populous towns in the Midland Counties, and opened a communication
        through a country where a very imperfect one had hitherto existed. This
        advantage the people have largely partaken of, and their desire to do so
        every day increases as the communication becomes more known and speedy
        intercourse appreciated.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Few, if any lines of Railway can boast of
        greater fertility of soil, of more elegant woodland scenery, or more
        specimens of architectural interest than the Valley of the Nene, through
        which this Railway entirely runs; and the traveller will find throughout
        its whole length one continued picturesque variety of hill and vale,
        wood and water, to diversify the landscape and rivet his attention; and
        it will be the object of the writer as he proceeds, to point out to him
        everything that may deserve notice, or that may attract his eye; so that
        whilst &quot;he drags at each remote his lengthening chain&quot; it will
        be the authors wish to lessen a number of its links by giving him
        amusement with instruction.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><i>The following extracts the text that relates
        only to the journey from Blisworth to Northampton.</i>&nbsp; This Line
        branches from the London and Birmingham Line at the BLISWORTH STATION,
        62 miles from London, and is situated in the parish of Blisworth, in the
        county of Northampton, by a fine curve to the right, crossing
        immediately the Grand Junction Canal upon a bridge of piles, and
        entering upon an embankment nearly twenty-feet high proceeds across the
        valley in a straight line about three-quarters of a mile. Being fairly
        launched upon our voyage, the first object of interest to the left, is a
        fine brick bridge of one arch, crossing the Birmingham Line distant
        about 200 yards; and still more to the left one and a half miles in the
        distance is the tower of Gayton Church, prettily situated upon the
        summit of the hill encircled by trees. The Manor-House, now reduced to
        the condition of a farm-house, but retains the characteristics of the
        Elizabethan domestic architecture. A White Bridge of one arch over the
        Canal against a few farm-houses will not escape observation, and is a
        pleasing object. Half way across the embankment we have on the right a
        splendid view of the fine vale, and looking a little behind we have a
        good prospect of the London Line running along upon an embankment at the
        foot of the hill; as also the commodious booking offices and sheds of
        the Blisworth station. Half a mile distant upon the same side, Milton
        Church is a picturesque object; its low decorated spire being
        embellished by a rich back-ground of trees; and in the extreme distance,
        the fine White Mansion of Mr. Harris, is conspicuously situated, but
        attention to this residence will be again drawn when a few miles further
        advanced. We next enter a cutting about half a mile long, and fifteen
        feet deep, through which all view is obscured. This cutting is crossed
        near the entrance by a wooden bridge upon brick pillars, leading from
        the villages of Milton and Collingtree on the right, to Gayton on the
        left, and 200 yards further there is an occupation bridge again crossing
        it of the same character. Upon emerging from this cutting, a little to
        the left is the Northampton Canal, which runs a considerable distance by
        the edge<i> </i>of the line, the water in which is held up a great
        height here by means of seventeen pairs of locks between this point and
        the lock-house, a distance of half a mile. On this side the scenery is
        delightful. Amidst clustering trees may be seen the interesting tower of
        Rothersthorpe Church and Village; as also an extensive and fertile
        valley, adorned by graceful woods. On the right, fifty yards from the
        Line, is Milton Ham, a farm-house occupied by Mr. John Manning; and
        again an excellent view is obtained of Wootten Hall, the seat of Mr.
        Harris, beautifully situated upon the brow of the hill, two miles
        distant. At sixty-five miles from London we cross a valley upon an
        embankment a quarter of a mile long and ten feet high; when on the top
        of the hill to the right a pretty farm-house is seen occupied by Mr,
        Joseph Dickens. The Line now curves gracefully to the left, and a
        quarter of a mile further on it is crossed by a road leading from
        Northampton to the Village of Rothersthorpe, distant about one mile.
        Near this place the call again curves to the right, and a cutting about
        twelve feet deep and half a mile in length commences. We have now on the
        left the first view of the River Nene flowing about fifty yards beyond
        the canal, which is again close to the Line. Across the river several
        flour mills are built, and still more to the left we see the hill
        covered with wood winding far away, until its blue top is lost in the
        extremity of the distance. The Line is now carried forward on an
        embankment 600 yards long, when to the right we see on the hill top 60
        yards distant Huntsbury Hill, commonly known as the Danes Camp, the
        pleasing residence of William Shaw, Esq., but the property of Edward
        Bouverie, Esq., and near to which is the favourite fox covert of the
        same name, well known to sportsmen.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">At the point marked 66 upon the mile-post there
        is a short cutting about ten feet deep, the Line still curving to the
        right, over which there is a wooden bridge supported by red brick
        pillars. One mile to the left may be seen the tower of Duston Church,
        and near to it a New White House, the residence of the Rev. W. Gravell.
        A monastery was founded here in 1112, for Black Canons, by William
        Peverel, natural son of William the Conqueror, styled St. James Abbey,
        and some remains of it are still visible. Upton Hall, bosomed in deep
        woods on the slope of the hill two miles distant is also visible. A
        castle was built here by Simon de Lyz, of which there are some ruins
        still remaining. The town of Northampton is now in a direct line before
        us, of which there is a fine panoramic view, but it is better seen by
        the traveller from the railway carriage just as he has swept round the
        sharp curve to the left where the canal is crossed by the pretty little
        white bridge . . . </font><i><font color="#000080">continues</font></p>
