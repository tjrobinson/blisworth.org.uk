        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Thanks to David Chambers (Cogenhoe
        - railways collector),
      who answered a query placed on the <a href="http://www.smj.me">www.smj.me</a>
      website, the precise location of the mail catcher apparatus at Blisworth
      may now be reported with certainty.&nbsp; He is in possession of a good
      photographic copy of a Victorian linen map of a very long stretch of the
      main line which includes Blisworth Station.&nbsp; The map probably
      predates <a href="../Station&#32;Maps/01-southend.htm"> the station map</a> already on this website and shows enough
      detail.&nbsp; Mail was caught on the embankment between the road arch
      bridge and the cast-iron and concrete canal bridge.&nbsp; The main map
      reproduced here shows the location some 240 yards away from the canal
      bridge and probably well hidden by trees growing on the embankment.&nbsp;
      Catching was done on both the down line and the up line and each catching
      station had a small hut, positioned ahead of the &quot;fork&quot;, for the
      postman to sit in while waiting for the express.&nbsp; Surprisingly the
      map shows no path down from the embankment and therefore one surmises a
      path must have been established making for the lane, Ford Lane now known
      as Station Road, somewhere near the canal bridge.</font><p align="left"><font color="#000080">Derek
        Smeathers (Northampton - local expert on all postal matters) is pleased
        to learn of the &quot;catchers' location&quot; having tried, <font size="3">along
        with George Freeston, </font>to gain this information<font size="3"> for
        many years.&nbsp; The name is new to him; the usual description in
        postal circles is a &quot;mail exchange apparatus&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#000080" size="3">
        In a little handbook published in 1971 by Harold S Wilson are some
        details about the apparatus.&nbsp; The original design for the apparatus
        was made by Nathaniel Worsdell in late 1837, but the GPO refused to buy
        his patent and behind his back they encouraged a young Post Office
        worker to produce a fresh design. It was his apparatus that was erected
        at Blisworth but it apparently failed or gave so much trouble that it
        was abandoned after a few weeks. It must have been replaced or repaired
        as referred to in the GPO accounts of 9th June 1840.</font><font color="#000080"><font size="3">&nbsp;
        The next notable date is 1860 - </font>Derek Smeathers has</font><font color="#000080" size="3"> a copy
        of a Time Bill of 1860 for the Irish Mail train which left Euston at
        8.30pm and used the Blisworth apparatus at 9.59pm and the Weedon
        apparatus 9 minutes later!&nbsp; By 1890, quite a number of the Mail
        Trains were calling at Northampton and thus avoiding Blisworth, though
        the Liverpool Morning and Day Mails both called at Blisworth (first stop
        from Euston) using apparatus at Bletchley and Watford Junction but not
        at Blisworth since there would be time to offload onto the platform.&nbsp;
        What it was like attending to the catcher <a href="../../Lyrical/edgar-ayres.htm">is
        recorded here</a>.</font><p align="left"><font color="#000080"><font size="3">The
      main map also shows the path of the ex-mill stream through one of two
      culverts built under the embankment.&nbsp; There are also shown some pipes
      extending from the lowest point in Station Road, which still floods oc</font>casionally, to join the stream at the culvert.&nbsp; The pipes also link
        up with the spring in the middle of Stockwell Field.&nbsp; A very small
        &quot;cottage&quot; is shown very near to the southern edge of the
        reservoirs for the Tank House.&nbsp; The main road is
      marked as a &quot;Turnpike&quot; which means that the original mapping was
        done before 1875 and the first use of mail catching must have been before
      that date too - but we already know that from the details of the previous
        paragraph.&nbsp; Some say that by 1945 the catchers had fallen into
        disuse.</font>
