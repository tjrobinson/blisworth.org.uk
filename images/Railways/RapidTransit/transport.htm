      response to the <b>HS2</b> plans, that being a bold plan to link London
      and Birmingham with an entirely new track passing, probably, close to
      Brackley, <b>NCC</b> have voiced their concern that Northampton will not
      benefit from the new track and that a new station should be established on
      the (old) main line at Blisworth to provide at least 4 trains each day
      offering access to London within about 40 minutes.&nbsp; It has been noted
      that Castle Station, Northampton has little prospect of improvement.&nbsp;
      As any further stations placed on the main line will generally slow down <u>all</u>
      the services, maybe a better plan would be to establish a new town near
      Brackley where those workers, keen to commute to London, could establish
      their homes.</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In
        1994 the transport company <b> RTI</b> (Rapid Transport International plc)
        reported on a survey of the needs of many Midlands towns.&nbsp;
        Northampton was the subject of a proposed major network based on limited
        pathway buses (similar to the 2011 scheme eventually put into commission
        for Cambridge and north Cambridgeshire).&nbsp; These limited pathways
        need either to run alongside the conventional car and lorry roadways or
        run in dedicated new roadways.&nbsp; Phase II of the
        scheme showed the new bus network extending to all outer regions of the
        town based on the specialised buses using ordinary roads.&nbsp; Phase I concentrated on renewing James Way and building new
        connections across Cotton End.&nbsp; To the southwest of that
        &quot;circuit&quot; (see blue/white in the diagram below - a new limited
        pathway) there was
        proposed further limited access pathway around the end of Hunsbury Hill
        crossing the M1 at the point where the new A43 made the crossing in
        2000 (Junction 15A) and terminating at the disused Blisworth Station
        area.&nbsp; A brand new station there would serve also as a freight
        terminal and the area between Blisworth Arm and Rothersthorpe would
        become a densely populated industry and warehouse area.&nbsp; There
        would need to be a large car-parking area to the north of the tracks
        perhaps just where the Blisworth Marina was established some 12 years
        later.</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>One
        felt at the time that the idea was stimulated by the financial failure
        of Arm Farm at Blisworth Arm with the&nbsp; consequent passing of the
        farm land into the hands of a bank.&nbsp; Such an asset would require
        development, would it not?
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        concern of the Blisworth residents was based on increase vehicular
        traffic from the south to the Freight Terminal and a few residents who
        lived very near the proposed station were concerned with the noise and
        loss of amenity.&nbsp; Blisworth need not have worried because it
        rapidly became evident that the railways companies could not cope with
        the express schedules (the 110mph through trains) alongside of the
        slowly starting and stopping freight trains - there simply was not room
        enough the accommodate more &quot;alongside slow loops&quot;, especially
        on the embankment and the bridge.&nbsp; Meanwhile a very worried
        Northampton Borough council wondered how the scheme might be phased in
        without total gridlock in a town hitherto deprived of good through
        roads.</span></font></p>

        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">3.
        There will be no access by car to the station from either Towcester Road
        or Station Road.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">4.
        The Parkway Station will be an addition to the current commuter service

        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">5.
        The improvement of public transport infrastructure is an essential
        feature of sustainable development, and is in full accord with the
        statutory planning framework at national, regional, County and District
        scales.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">6.
        The community in Greater Northampton need, and will take great benefit
        from improved access to InterCity West Coast rail services.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">7.
        The proposed International Parkway Station at Blisworth would also
        become the County's &quot;Gateway to Europe&quot; by providing access to
        European Passenger Services.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">8.
        The proposal is technically feasible and will enable Northamptonshire to
        benefit from the modernisation of the West Coast Main Line over the next
        ten years.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">9.
        The new station would be linked to park and ride facilities being
        designed as part of the emerging Northampton Rapid Transit System.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">10.
        The proposal reinstates Blisworth as an important location on the West
        Coast Main Line - the proposal is on the site of the former Blisworth
        Junction station which closed in 1960.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; padding-top: 0"><font color="#000080">Evidently
        the councillors were reassured because <b> RTI</b> with its grand scheme lived
        on.&nbsp; On October 14, 1997 it was announced that the scheme had been
        approved only to be followed on the very next day with the verdict of
        planners who rejected the plan.&nbsp; See the following newspaper clip:</font></p>
        <p align="center" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; padding-top: 0"><img border="0" src="1997.jpg" width="781" height="403"></p>
      </font>
      <p><img src="plan&#32;1999.jpg" align="left" height="352" width="200">
      <font color="#000080">Still the scheme was not abandonned.&nbsp; In June 1999 the papers carried
      broad plans to enhance the railways links as evidenced by the inset plan
      shown here.&nbsp; The new A43 bypass for Blisworth is incorporated in the
      plan and, as we know, that bypass was completed approximately two years
      later.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">At this stage (July 2011) it will probably help to contact Northampton Borough to ask of
      the whereabouts of <b>RTI</b> - does it still live?&nbsp; The fact that, in 2010, the Borough announced a
      complex multi-phase scheme, taking two decades to execute, to improve access to the town from
      the point of view of pedestrians, cyclists, bus users, delivery companies
      and public cars etc. seems to indicate that the <b>RTI</b> or anything
      like it is in fact dead.&nbsp; That plan includes the 2009/10 improvements near the
      entrance to the railways station and on the outer Weedon Road.&nbsp; It
      was put out in 2010 for public comments.&nbsp; As yet, there have been no revisions
      announced.&nbsp; The plan did not extend far outside the Borough boundaries and
      so the future of the shaded area near Blisworth is still in the lap of the
      Gods (ie. bankers).</font></p>
