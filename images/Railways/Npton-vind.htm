<p align="left" style="padding-left: 140; padding-right: 140"><font color="#000080"><b>A
monograph was researched and written in 1935 by Joan Wake, Hon. Sec.
Northamptonshire Record Society on the political goings-on in the early 19th
century when Stephenson was planning his London to Birmingham railway through
the County.&nbsp; It is a 31 page booklet and now out of print.&nbsp; Victor
Hatley has also more recently reviewed this topic but, here, is a synopsis of Joan
Wake's account.</b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">What
has become practically a legend is the idea that the main line missed
Northampton by 4 miles (in skirting Blisworth) because 'the Town' was against
it.&nbsp; The earliest mention of the legend is by Thomas Roscoe &quot;the
original line of the London and Birmingham railway, as marked out by Mr
Stephenson, was through Northampton; so great, however, was the opposition that
certain parties in authority entertained to it, that the bill was consequently
lost.&quot;&nbsp; Ten years later Sir Francis Head repeated the story using
colourful language, viz, &quot;barbarous force&quot; and there followed
persistent screaming abuse, viz. &quot;the idiocy of Northampton&quot; and the
previous term upgraded to &quot;barbarous fury&quot; in around 1888.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">The
railway project in its infancy, c. 1825, faced extreme engineering problems and
an evident frenzied opposition from landowners virtual along the entire path,
viz. &quot;it will be injurious to property and ruin the noble sport of hunting
. . .&quot;&nbsp; The L &amp; B R Company was formed on Sept 1830 with George
Stephenson and son Robert appointed as engineers.&nbsp; A survey committee was
set up.&nbsp; On Oct 27, this committee was lobbied in Birmingham by a party
from Northampton that the town should be &quot;on the line&quot;.&nbsp; At the time, the company
was happy to comply.&nbsp; The survey proceeded and had chosen various lines
which all, unfortunately, bypassed Northampton by about 4 miles.&nbsp; This was supposed to be
because Northampton was too difficult to include and it is later reported that
Stephenson had observed, &quot;it easy to get an engine into the town but impossible to
get it out again.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;The
Mayor and a group of Tory and Anglican councillors in the Northampton
Corporation were outspoken in opposition to the railway <u>in general</u> - they
were merely supporting the landowners in their fury.&nbsp; They went as far as
damning railways either through or near the town - a branch line, which was included in
the surveys, was not mentioned.&nbsp; Realising they had been misunderstood they
however withdrew their dissent in 1831.&nbsp; However, this mattered not much to the
railway planners who had received a further input that the railway should skirt
closely by <a href="../Canaltwo.htm#barracks"> Weedon Barracks and the Ordnance
Store</a> on the Grand Junction Canal.&nbsp; Stephenson deposited in November
1831, at the County Hall in Northampton, the somewhat refined plan which favoured
the westerly route, going through Bugbrooke and close to Weedon. &nbsp; Perhaps
in tiring of the continuous clamour he omitted the branch line to Northampton,
perhaps the issue of level differences was still too difficult to overcome.&nbsp; Action then shifted to Westminster as the plan was considered
in a Bill.&nbsp; In committee, Stephenson declared that the line would be later enhanced with a branch line to Northampton.&nbsp; There was not a single word in
opposition to this plan and its bill from the Northampton Corporation.&nbsp; Tradesmen and manufacturers
in the town were vociferous in their insistence the line should go through
Northampton.&nbsp; In point of fact, it was not until about 1880 that this faction had acquired any
clout in the planning of the town.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">The
two key landowners, Wake and Grafton, objected to the line and the Bill was
lost.&nbsp; In Oct 1832, the railway company resolved to try again with
&quot;much more attention to the great landowners, especially amongst the
Lords&quot;.&nbsp; By Jan 1833, behind closed doors, Wake and Grafton had
finally assented.&nbsp; The line would cut deeper into Blisworth Hill in a
longer cutting and would enter the vale at a height of 15 yards above the
earlier plan.&nbsp; In effect, the line was being placed somewhat nearer to
Blisworth, passing on an embankment, and would skirt rather than bisect the all important land
owned by the Northampton Corporation in Bugbrooke.&nbsp; The line was opened in
Sept 1838 and a very simple station was place at the embankment arch near
Blisworth, to be used by Northampton and Towcester.&nbsp; That a better station was built a
few years later just to the west of the arch was very much due to the pressure
from the Duke of Grafton - it was crystallised in an Act passed in 1843 which
also included <a href="branch.htm"> a branch line into Northampton</a>, later to be extended to
Peterborough.&nbsp; However, an additional loop off the main line, which allowed trains direct from Birmingham or London
to pass into the Town, was not provided until 1875.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 60"><font color="#000080">It
was quite clear that the railway company never intended to take the line into
Northampton - probably because of the difference in levels [<i>a Northampton
station located somewhere near Briar Hill, to the south of the river would have
satisfied the levels problem but would have left the railway then facing east
for an ongoing route for Birmingham and the station would have not been near the
town centre</i>] A large faction, without voice, wanted
the railway and the ill-considered objections from the Corporation lasted for
only 7 months.&nbsp; Long enough for Stephenson to not try too hard to overcome
the level problems but attend to more pressing issues.</font></p>
