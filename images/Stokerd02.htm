        Westley in 1839.&nbsp; It was part of the Grafton Estate in 1812,
        referred to as &quot;House, yard and garden&quot;.&nbsp; Buildings 1 and 2 are the oldest built in stone
        that were demolished in 1939.&nbsp; Building 4, in brick, was also demolished by
        the council at about the same time.&nbsp; The buildings drawn in darker
        colour are those present today - VH is Victoria House and building 3 is
        its very close neighbour, both in brick.</p>
        <p>The horizontally oriented rectangle is the location of the new
        doctor's surgery which was created by converting in c. 1975 a private
        bungalow built in c. 1955.&nbsp; Other buildings were present in 1839
        but presumably lost in the subsequent building operations.</p>

        <p>The section of Stoke Road between the above
        mentioned cottages and the Stoneworks farm runs along the side of the
        deep excavation for the canal.&nbsp; It became
        obvious that the ground was too unstable and the edge of the road become
        'challenged'.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer of 2000 the road was narrowed as
        shown and, finally after a good deal of legal wangling with British Waterways,
        work to stabilise the road using large steel cages full of rocks, was
        completed in the summer of 2002.</p>
        <p>Although the date of <a href="Miscplaces.htm#border">this photograph</a>
        is not known, it is obvious that a distinct width of grass border has

        A great picture of the stone Works house, complete with probably the original

        shape. It is thought to be dated 1913 and has been provided by Gail Kae who is
        a descendant of George Wills (see below)</center></p>

      <a name="wills"></a>
      explained in an article on the <a href="Articles/Stone-works.html"> devious ways of John
      Roper</a>, the quarry in
      the field behind this house (that was built c1840) was first run by Robert
      Rogers c. 1805 - 1812.&nbsp; He was replaced by John Dix&nbsp; c1819
      evidently installed by Roper (the influential agent for D. of
      Grafton).&nbsp; John Dix was sacked in 1825 by Roper who put his own son
      Benedict Roper in charge.&nbsp; Dix must have had his &quot;nose put
      out&quot; for he disclosed the shady financial practices of Roper to the
      new agent in 1837.&nbsp; In fact, Roper was sacked as agent in c1834 and
      died in 1837.&nbsp; Benedict Roper was removed from quarrying by the Duke in 1837 but he
      became one of a few favoured farmers in the parish, installed in what was
      then called Lodge Farm on the Gayton Hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 80; padding-right: 80">What happened next is less
      clear.&nbsp; The 1841 census shows that two builders <a href="Railway&#32;Arch/dunkley.htm"> Richard Dunkley</a> and George Wills
      (portrait from Gail Kae shown in inset) and quite a number of labourers were counted as living at the
      &quot;Works&quot; house.&nbsp; There were 43 people; apart from the Wills
      and Dunkley families, six or so lodgers and five servants, there were the
      families: Townsend (labourers), Mayo (labourers), Gudgeon (farmer), Henson
      (builder) and Haymaker (labourers). One can surmise that some were actually
      building the house at that time.&nbsp; Dunkley was 30 at the time,15 years junior to
      Wills, but clearly had made a mark in the area by building the Railway
      Arch.&nbsp; One wonders whether Wills was Dunkley's mentor sometime
      earlier.&nbsp; It is also a strong probability
      that George Wills, originally from Stony-Stratford, was foreman at the
      quarry from 1837 onwards.&nbsp; Indeed, the skills of George Wills may
      have been familiar to the Duke of Grafton many years earlier when Wills
      was living in Tottenham Court Road, London, presumably building some
      fashionable town houses only a quarter mile from Grafton's Euston
      House.&nbsp; At some point Grafton became the Wills's patron.&nbsp; This
      was all surmised from Gail Kae's researches.&nbsp; Richard Dunkley moved on to build the Station Hotel for Mr.
      Shaw of Northampton and The Loundes next to the hotel for himself.&nbsp;
      By the time of the 1851 census George Wills was still at the Works.&nbsp;
      Dunkley was counted as living in Blisworth but the precise house cannot be
      discerned.&nbsp; In the 1861 census no-one was apparently permanently living at
      the Stone Works.&nbsp; George Wills had died in July 1857 but his
      stone-mason business lived on; George left his business in Stony Stratford
      to his son Jabez Wills and his business in Northampton to son-in-law
      William Slaymaker.&nbsp; After William sold his share of the business to
      Jabez, before emigrating to America in 1870, Jabez and his later descendants,
      Frederick and Frederick Jnr., kept
      the family stone masonry business going into the 1980s.&nbsp; It is
      thought that the business, 1970-80, was involved in work at the Houses of
      Parliament.</p>

        The provision of cement during the repairs to the canal tunnel put an
        end to the tree.&nbsp; It was a sad story - one load of cement powder
        being delivered was squirted into the already full silo on the building
        site across the road, rather than the empty one, and the safety relief
        valve, in turn, squirted a cloud of powder over the tree and the
        buildings.&nbsp; This excess of lime sealed the pores through which the
        tree lived and brought it to a sorry state within a few years.</td>
