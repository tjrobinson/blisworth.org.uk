        furniture and wearing apparel belonging to the different occupiers;

        </b><i>About eleven o'clock on Monday morning a terrible fire broke out at
        Blisworth, near this town, occasioned by a girl incautiously throwing
        some hot ashes into a farm-yard, which falling upon some straw set fire
        to the same, and almost instantly communicated to the thatch of the
        surrounding buildings. The fire began at Mr. Hedge's farm, whose house
        together with 11 others was in a short time consumed, besides a number
        of barns and other out-buildings, several stacks of corn and hay, a
        large quantity of grain, flour, &amp;c.- three or four pigs and some
        poultry also perished in the flames, the rapidity of which was such,
        that many of the unfortunate inhabitants were able to save but a small
        part of their household furniture, &amp;c. Upon the news arriving here,
        the Supplementary Militiamen immediately set off from hence with
        engines, to assist the sufferers, and were very instrumental in stopping
        the progress of the flames. The property destroyed amounts to a very
        considerable sum; and what renders the calamity the greater, not the
        smallest part of it was insured.</i></font></span></p>

        records it appears likely that Joseph Hedge lived at Crieff House - the
        problem being mainly that Joseph, specifically, is not mentioned.&nbsp; A feature of one or two houses in the village,
        before they were demolished in the 1930's, was that the thatched roof
        extended, on one side, down to within a yard or two of the ground.&nbsp;
        Perhaps it was a building of such a design behind Crieff House which was the first to catch
        fire.&nbsp; <a href="The-Cross/behind-cross.jpg">Click here</a> to see a
        photograph heavily modified by G Freeston showing a building being
        re-thatched having very low eaves in one place.
        <p align="center" style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 35; padding-bottom: 24">So far, there is evidence for fire damage
        along the High Street on the opposite side to the Royal Oak Inn and for a short
        distance along the Stoke Road.&nbsp; Insurance was not fashionable in
        those days and measures were doubtless taken by the Rector and officials
        in neighbouring parishes to produce a fund from public contributions and church
        money to re-house the unfortunate villagers.&nbsp; The Duke of Grafton
        probably helped also - he immediately put into action plans to insure
        the buildings of all his key tenants, ie. the farmers.&nbsp; At the time, 1798, the
        Grafton Estate was about to be re-organised on the basis of new
        farm houses with more extensive buildings set up typically a half to one
        mile outside the village, amidst clusters of associated fields.&nbsp;
        This might explain why some houses in the High Street were not replaced
        for over fifty years.<p align="center" style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 35; padding-bottom: 24"><b><font size="4">Below are maps and accounts of individual houses for

        The birds-eye view of this corner house shows a substantial frontage on
        the high Street in 1727.&nbsp; By 1839 the house is a relatively narrow
        gable &quot;end-on&quot; to the High Street and so is likely to be a
        replacement because of the fire.&nbsp; An examination of the building
        which is now at that place shows a narrow gable but there are some
        indications it has been modified at some time later in the 19th century.&nbsp; The building housed a shop
        at the corner from approximately 1880 and it incorporated the village
        post office.&nbsp; This was the second location of the post office on
        the High Street (see<a href="TheCross.htm"> image <b>32-04</b></a>).</p>

        Nothing is said of this place in the survey document of 1839 but it
        appears that the draughtsman has recorded the existence of a building platform abutting the street.&nbsp; Interestingly, the gap left after the fire remains unfilled today.</p>

        The 1839 survey states that this place was &quot;in ruins&quot;.&nbsp; In
        1866 the plot was sold to the Northampton Progressionists Society (a
        forerunner of the Northampton Co-operative Society) in order to build a
        general shop primarily for farmer's produce.&nbsp; The society collapsed
        shortly afterwards and the shop was taken up (maybe purchased as a
        freeholding) by Walter Young who made a success of the shop as a general
        village store.&nbsp; His descendants ran it as &quot;<a href="Shop.htm">Young's Store</a>&quot;
        until the 1970's after which time it was extended a little into the
        nearby gap to accommodate the post office in its third and current location.</font></p>

        1839 survey states that this place was &quot;in ruins&quot;.&nbsp; In
        1845 the plot was considered briefly as suited for an extension to the <a href="schools.htm">
        village school</a> in the Stoke Road.&nbsp; In deeds prepared but not
        implemented for transfer to the church, the building is described as a barn.&nbsp; At
        some point a single large house was built set further back from the
        street on the site of this barn.&nbsp; It was later divided into two
        dwellings with the lower one <font color="#FF0000"> being the first location of the village
        <a href="Articles/post_office_services.htm">
        post office</a></font><a href="Articles/post_office_services.htm">.</a>&nbsp; By the early 20th century, the house was re-combined
        as one, possessing the
        name &quot;Tile House&quot;. The occupants ran a tea garden to the
        rear.&nbsp; By 1952 it was still recorded as one unit and was, in that
        year, formally numbered No.21.&nbsp; At a subsequent unknown date the
        house was divided again into two: Nos. 21 &amp; 21A.</font></p>

        survey of 1839 marks this building as just one dwelling.&nbsp; It
        appears to have not been damaged by the fire in that its position agrees
        well with what was recorded in 1727.</p>

        depicted in 1839 seem to tally with those of 1727.&nbsp; However the
        buildings were certainly demolished in the 19th century to leave a gap
        for at least a few years.&nbsp; What has been known
        as &quot;The Gables&quot;, a cluster of three dwellings, was built
        on the site by the Duke of Grafton in a distinctive style, especially
        with regard to the tiled
        roof, recognisable elsewhere in the village.&nbsp; They were probably
        built in around 1875.&nbsp; By 1952 they were numbered 27 (The Gables),
        29 (Police Station - PC Wooding) and 31 (Rose Cottage).</p>

        This house was actually on the High Street.&nbsp; In 1839 and right up
        to around 1960 there was a modest sized abode at this place.&nbsp; In c.
        1930 it was occupied by a cobbler.&nbsp; What appears to be a long barn
        in the 1727 plan was evidently lost in the fire.&nbsp; The cobbler's
        house (see <a href="Highsttwo.htm"> image <b>16-12a</b></a>) was demolished in about 1960 and,
        remarkably, its residual
        gable can still be seen as part of a garden wall - a testament to the
        smallness of&nbsp; the house.<p style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 35"><a href="Attic.htm"><img height="226" src="Greatfire/composite.jpg" width="280" align="left">
        </a>
        <b><font size="4">(b)</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particularly
        interesting house was named <a href="Articles/About-westleys.html">
        Crieff House</a> late in the 19th century.&nbsp; It was known as Grafton
        Cottage in 1881 but there is no name in census records before
        then.&nbsp; The 1881 naming surely stems from an occupancy by the two
        daughters of the late publican at &quot;The <i> Grafton</i>
        Arms&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is clear that a wing of
        the structure was lost in the fire.&nbsp; It now has only a gable end-on
        to the street but formerly there was <i> either</i> a semi-detached <i> separate</i>
        dwelling or a wing of the main house, as shown in the 1727 plan.&nbsp;
        The house is interesting in that for only the gable corner facing the
        High Street can be seen sandstone quoins.&nbsp; It was thought likely that the corner closest to building <b>(a)</b> has similar quoins
        but due to obscuration by additions
        to the building early in the 20th century, indicated in the 1960 plan, this
        is not obvious.&nbsp; Some pictures taken at a time when the wall
        covering was removed show that the east elevation is a plain rubble wall
        with no quoins at all.&nbsp; Sandstone, being more expensive, is not a common material for quoins in
        Blisworth but surely two corners should be built to match one
        another.&nbsp; This is puzzling and might suggest that the entire
        eastern part of the house was destroyed by fire.&nbsp; The building was originally perhaps a small mansion with a
        further building or extension semi- detached to it.&nbsp; Note that Grafton lets both to the same
        tenant in 1727 but the mapmaker has clearly put a line between the two parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; A further point of interest is that a view from inside the roof shows
        old rafters which are just blackthorn branches in the round from, no
        doubt, a local coppice as shown in the inset (a 'stitched' composite picture).&nbsp; Perhaps the larger part of the building lost
        its thatch in the fire and, in a hurry
        to get it re-covered, anything serviceable would be used at a time when
        timber was in demand.&nbsp; To view other pictures taken in
        this attic click on the image. </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 35"><b><font size="4">(c) </font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The row of three modest
        abodes shown in 1839 appear to have survived the fire - which is
        surprising.&nbsp; The division nearest the Stoke Road was demolished in around 1930.&nbsp; The remaining divisions were merged in 2000 to form
        one cottage now called Crieff Cottage (see <a href="Demolition.htm">image
        <b>10-02</b></a>).</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 35"><b><font size="4">(d), (e)&nbsp; </font></b> This is the site of the
        house of Joseph Westley snr. who was the chief baker with a bake-house
        behind his house.&nbsp; Both were possibly held <i>freehold</i> at the
        time - they certainly were by 1839 because the drawings are hatched in
        the plan.&nbsp; After the fire he rebuilt his house (see <a href="baconfactory.htm">image
        <b>02-06</b></a>) in a three-storey gable end-on
        configuration <b>(e)</b> to permit direct access to his bake-house (see <a href="Earlyindust.htm">image&nbsp;<b>
        11-03</b></a>) from
        the road.&nbsp; He was fortunate in that the neighbouring building <b>(f)</b>,
        the school, was also destroyed so that he could purchase, from either
        church or the Duke of Grafton, a narrow strip of land to make the
        configuration a success.&nbsp; That narrow strip is coloured green in
        the 1727 plan above.&nbsp; Westley paid £40 for the strip - money which
        used in the rebuilding of the school.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 35"><b><font size="4">(f) </font></b>&nbsp; The school, endowed by the
        Wake family in the 16th century but run and probably owned by the church
        in 1839.&nbsp; It is hatched in brown and not pink to match the drawing
        of the church building on the same map.&nbsp; Destroyed in 1798 and
        rebuilt almost immediately, it is set back from the road by a few yards as shown in
        the 1839 plan.&nbsp; The school was built right up against Westley's new
        house.<br>
        The school had needed an extension for many years and
        in 1861 a gable was built to use up some of the area between the building and the street.&nbsp; It seems likely that a second floor was
        also added at the time.&nbsp; The transverse layout with a gable
        extending to the street is the plan of the school which is recognisable
        today.&nbsp; Westley's house was occupied by a meat processing company
        in 1924 <a href="Demolition.htm"> but pulled</a> down for housing development in c. 1974.&nbsp; This
        left the, by then <a href="schools.htm"> disused school</a>, with no semi-detachment to other
        buildings and it was converted to the village hall in the late 1970's.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 35; padding-bottom: 40"><b><font size="4">(g) </font></b>&nbsp; Between buildings <b>(f)</b>
        and <b>(g)</b> there appears to have been a small barn - now lost.&nbsp;
        Judging from the boundaries which are currently recognised, this barn
        would have probably been associated with building <b>(g)</b>.<br>
        Building <b>(g)</b> is a substantial gable end-on farm house
        (see <a href="Stokerd01.htm">image <b>30-07</b></a>) that certainly lost its roof in the fire.&nbsp; The upstairs was damaged
        severely as suggested by the marked orange staining of the mullions of
        an upstairs window.&nbsp; There may have been fire damage further along
        the Stoke Road.&nbsp; The next building was another farm, Home Farm,
        which was demolished in 1972 for reasons of the same housing development
        mentioned above.&nbsp; There is no recorded evidence of damage and the 1727
        and 1839 plans are rather similar.</p>
