          brief:</font></b>&nbsp; In September 2006 Philip Cahill, a local
          artist, created a magnificent panel depicting an assembly of motifs
          collected from photographs and ideas around the village.&nbsp; The
          panel was eight foot tall and is shown below.&nbsp; Led by Carol
          Arnall a group of &quot;stitchers&quot; mostly from the village
          created a tapestry based on this art work, in panels that were
          cleverly bonded together.&nbsp; The panel entitled &quot;Blisworth -
          Present Day&quot; was mounted in the Baptist Chapel Coffee Room by
          December 2007 when it was unveiled by Sir Hereward Wake.</font></p>
          <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Tapestry/p-cahill-work.jpg" width="500" height="980"></p>
          <p align="center"><font color="#000080">The group continued with a
          relatively daunting project: the creation of six panels which depict
          the history of the village, in stages, from Roman times to the present
          day.&nbsp; The unveiling, again by Sir Hereward Wake, of the six
          panels took place in February 2010 to make a display that spans the
          east wall of the Coffee shop.</font></p>

          <p align="center"><font color="#000080">The artwork for each of the
          panels was created by other local artists, some of them with Philip
          Cahill, which include Tony Maycock, Maggie Turton, Ivan Chester and
          Maureen Smith.&nbsp; Some have said that the work will be a heritage
          landmark for visitors and maybe even for tourists coming to Blisworth
          - congratulations for the achievement are extended by all.&nbsp;
