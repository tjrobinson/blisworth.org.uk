        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        <p>An aerial shot taken in about 1974 shows the remains of foundations
        of the old steam-roller shed at the top of Little Lane where it joins the
        High Street.&nbsp;The small yard next to the shed was in the hands of
        the county council and used for storing kerb stones, gravel and drain
        parts.&nbsp; Subsequently, the lane was widened.&nbsp; The cottage
        on the left is Jasmine Cottage and the dark wooden building a few yards
        along Little Lane was the second location for the telephone exchange at
        Blisworth.&nbsp; It was bought by a Northampton Scuba Group as a
        storeroom and meeting place in about 1960 when a large new telephone
        exchange building was built in a plot set back from the shed.&nbsp; For
        anyone not familiar with the appearance of a steamroller, here is a <a href="High-Street/Steamroller.jpg">picture
        of the very one</a> that was used.&nbsp; Neil Parton has written to us
        to tell us the machine, an Aveling and Porter, is in good health at the
        Klondyke Mill Preservation Centre in Staffordshire and has in its provenance
        the ownership of Northampton Council.&nbsp; We lack absolute proof of it
        being the very same machine.</p>
