        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">I
        thought it would be appropriate to
        summarise the results for you, as 18% of households in the Parish, so far,
        are represented by
        respondents to the recent opinion survey.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">First
        I need to explain a lack of thought and design to the questions. I
        forgot to ask whether the respondent was actually resident in the parish - so the
        survey mixes parishioners with a minority (assumed) of people who might
        live far away. In querying the satisfaction or disappointment level felt
        by the respondent I also forgot to ask whether he/she obtained successfully
        any needed information from the site or whether they were &quot;just
        browsing&quot; anyway. As I receive about 12 messages each year from
        media or publishing people requesting copies of some photographs, I
        should have asked whether the respondent was on the site pursuing work
        or school-work related topics.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>One
        question in the survey asked whether the viewer has noticed any faults on the
        website or any way things could be improved. Some 80% of users found
        nothing to report. Basically the size of the site catches people out.
        They find it confusing because there are a number of separate indexes
        and apart from clarifying some of the links I cannot see a way of
        overcoming that. I do wonder why people do not simply go to the search
        box on the home page and type in one or two keywords - that is what I do
        when I forget where exactly I have put something. I can tell from the
        server statistics that the search box is under-utilised. In programme
        terms the search box simply uses Google itself to run a <i>local search</i>
        for you. Google has spidered over every word on the site and usually
        gets to present everything that will be relevant</font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">,
        as long as you enter (separately) two or so sensible keywords.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Another question asked the
        viewer &quot;were they pleased with the site&quot;. Some 88% were
        pleased or fairly happy while three viewers expressed their
        disappointment. These three had good reason to react to my unfortunate
        mistake in reporting - I will try not to do it again! One viewer
        expressed his dislike of the rather large &quot;Blisworth Images&quot;
        label spread across all the archival pictures saying it was absurd,
        unnecessary and spoiled the presentation. He has a valid point but is
        the first respondent to ever mention this 'fault'. I suppose I should
        have gleaned whether or not he managed to get what he wanted from the
        site. Many respondents thought there was a 'hole' in the coverage from
        about 1950 to 1980 which of course includes the time when the village
        was enlarged considerably and the years in which a majority of the
        present residents
        grew up. I hope the recent inclusion of a group of old posters covering
        this period goes a little way to compensating for the gap. The other
        omissions some wished to point out were that there is no message board
        and there is little on recent news. I agree and I tried it once but gave
        up. I have wondered why
        no-one has started up a Facebook page for the village and suspect no one
        can afford the time. One viewer noted
        that there seemed to be a preponderance of articles by just one author
        and maybe the appeal of the website would be raised by including many
        others. Suffice to reply to this by saying the authors who <i> do</i> contribute
        form an exceedingly small minority of people in the village who actually
        <i>feel the urge </i> to either research or research-and- write and these people
        often have to be pestered to offer their work. I see no quick fix
        to this shortcoming!</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One question
        asked &quot;how often did the viewer return to the site&quot;. They were given the
        choice of&nbsp;&nbsp;Annually (24%), Monthly (49%), Weekly (6%) or
        simply Frequently (18%). There were 8 viewers who answered &quot;Never&quot;. Five of these
        had stated
        earlier they were happy with the site (but presumably weren't
        interested) and the remaining 3 were the same
        disappointed three mentioned above - so I believe I may have lost them for good!</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There
        was good support, 75% in fact, for the website in terms of providing a
        useful service alongside the other Blisworth-based websites. There was a
        more muted support for the website funding to be continued by the Parish
        Council if the present private funding (ie. from me) were to cease. The
        voting here was 60% in favour of continuing, 30% didn't know and 10%
        thought &quot;no, let it continue by other means&quot;. An auxiliary question
        might have been a good idea; I should have looked for &quot;how
        many of the <i>don't know</i>s doubted whether it would be an
        acceptable part of the <u> brief</u> of a Parish Council&quot;.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">I <b>always</b> avoid doing
        surveys offered by members of our complex services business sector,
        thinking they should damn well know what they are up to and don't
        deserve to receive any of my details. Not so true for this website which
        <u>has</u> benefited in some small ways from all your suggestions,
        without asking for your details, but even as a convert - I still won't do
        surveys! Nevertheless I hope you will do this one which <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/8KL9J7Y"> is still
        available</a>, if you haven't already done so.&nbsp;</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">And thank you, all.&nbsp;&nbsp;
