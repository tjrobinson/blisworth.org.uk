        </span>At the March 2014 Heritage Society meeting, a presentation by
        Hilary Spurrier, Beryl Andrews and Robin Freeston on the analysis of
        births in Blisworth gave a table showing the male and female births over
        the period 1750 to 1920. Between 1820 and 1900 the ratio of boy to girl
        births was reported as anomalously high, with an average of 1.295. This
        is a startlingly high value of the ratio. Considered typical of present day healthy society, a figure for the
        “Sex Ratio at Birth” (<b>SRB</b>) of 1.00 to 1.06 is expected.
        Higher values found in backward countries and in Asia are usually
        associated with the infanticide of female babies for reasons of birth
        control. The original data used for this work was R Freeston's overall
        Excel file of births, marriages and deaths. The study was repeated over
        a limited date range and a ratio of 1.202 was obtained. The averages in
        ratio obtained for the first and second studies seemed to be not in
        satisfactory accord. It was resolved to repeat the counting using a
        digital software programme written in Perl rather than counting records
        by eye from a computer screen.<o:p></span></font></p>

        phrases such as &quot;base born&quot; and &quot;bastard&quot; allow a
        logging of most baptisms of illegitimate children. In the original Excel
        file, once filtered for baptisms, there were 4934 valid entries and a
        justification for excluding 507 of them for a variety of reasons. A
        total of 247 entries were for visiting parents, incl. 3 adults, and so
        were ignored. They displayed an <b>SRB</b> ratio of 1.05, as a sub-group,
        and the importance of this is discussed later. There were 260 blank or
        seriously uninformative entries. The great majority of these (93%) were
        created in the interval 1550 to 1650. A closer examination was made of
        these, looking for mention of a given name so that entries could be
        classified for gender and this was possible for 87 entries. However,
        some may have corresponded to adults, possibly already baptised without
        their knowledge. For this reason this small group was finally omitted. A
        total of 64 illegitimate children were logged from 1550 – 1922 and the
        total was later adjusted for a reason that will become clear.<o:p>

11.0pt">As shown in <b> Table I</b>, the results differ quite markedly from previous surveys in some
        respects. A very high male bias is seen for the earliest century that
        was covered. This was not noticed before. The high male bias, initially
        noted for the Victorian period, this time is still perceptible but as a
        subtler rise (figures shown in red). The mild female bias in other
        centuries was not noticed before. One theory that might explain male
        bias assumes that a genetic factor is carried forward in a family so
        promoting a high incidence of male births. Accordingly, with the births
        records already divided into 50-year periods, a count was made of boys
        and girls against each surname in the records. There were a total of 800
        surnames but within any 50 year period there was typically only ~350
        present. The entire record was scanned for heavy male bias and the
        conclusion of this survey is presented in the table inset here, <b>Table
        II</b>.<o:p>

        only 31 family names sported a strong male bias at some stage (and
        rarely twice, interestingly). Such situations are highlighted in yellow
        while the relatively un-biassed periods for the families are shown with
        a white background. At each point the format of the entry is “boys
        comma girls”. A grey background is used where there are no births for
        a family within a particular 50-year period. This distinction, with grey,
        probably shows when a family has departed or just arrived in the
        village. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">A few families, eg. the
        Paceys, Gibbs and the Griffins, have occupied the village continuously
        from 1550 -1922 (but mysteriously have all now departed).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Carters began in the early 1700s and are still going strong
        today. Families that appear over two separate periods are presumed to be
        not closely related branches and have the same surname more-or-less by
        coincidence - eg. the Greens and the Watts.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">Before attempting to give any account of the
        results it is sometimes helpful in the massaging of complex data to
        extract what, to the scientist and engineer, is known as any dimensionless group<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. This promotes the suggestion of mathematical
        relationships between elements of the data. The <b>SRB</b> is already
        dimensionless, being a ratio without units. The data in <b>Tables I</b>
        and <b>II</b> could be combined as follows. One could note the count of
        male bias incidence with each 50-year period and compare that to the
        total number of baptisms for the same period. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Thus,
        as an example, the number of incidents in the 1750-1800 date range is 4.
        We set that as (4 +/- 1) and divide it by the level of birth activity in
        that period, which was 514 according to <b>Table I</b>. A &quot;families
        <u>per 100 births</u>&quot; index so formed is thus:<o:p>

        justification for the +/- 1 is that the measure of “actual male
        bias” is subjective and liable to error. The index is dimensionless
        because it is the quotient of two plain numbers. In the diagram below, <b>Figure
        1</b>, there is plotted against the date ranges both the <b>SRB</b>
        ratio and the <b>Fam/100</b> index.</font></span></p>

        inspection, there appears to be a correlation between these two factors

        confirm this impression just imagine the data for <b>SRB</b> being drawn
        lower down on the graph compared to where it is (ie. move by minus 0.1
        on the <b>SRB</b> scale). The <b>SRB</b> =<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>0 point, which is meaningless, is suppressed anyway. We see that,
        after 1800, the <b>SRB</b> takes off upwards and &quot;peaks&quot;,
        compared to an expectation based on the <b>Fam/100</b> index, at around
        the middle of the 1850-1900 date range.<o:p>

        have been common temptation for un-married young girls with all to loose
        because of the stigma. Up to about 1700 the law was clear on this issue
        and if the woman were found guilty on all three counts the sentence was
        a capital one, for what was termed “infanticide”. Some sympathy was
        being introduced in the 1600s and by 1800 the situation had become one

        </span></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Blisworth was essentially a small agricultural community. Social
        standards were established and maintained by the Lord of the Manor
        (being an agent of the King until ~1700), by the Rector and by some of
        the parish officials such as the Constable and the Overseer of the Poor.
        It seems inconceivable that much distortion of the records occurred due
        to infanticide, ie<b>. (i)</b> above. One only needs to inspect the low
        level of illegitimacy to feel convinced of this. Possibly there may have
        been a fair amount of unrecorded family wasting. The abstract for a
        treatise was found in the searches (see the <b>Appendix I</b>) that dealt
        with practices common in a German parish where arguments for reducing
        the count of girls was justified as the natural loss of young boys was
        always a major concern. (The loss of more boys than girls was recorded
        also in Blisworth). The high value of the <b>SRB</b> may be partly for
        reasons of unrecorded family wasting but probably only partly. A more likely
        contributory factor is the light level of inter-breeding within the
        community that would persist even though some males were encouraged to
        find their wives in the neighbouring villages. It was frequently the
        case that two families got on so well together that brothers married
        corresponding sisters. Subsequently the offspring would be genetically
        very close cousins, all the more confusing if three or four families
        were involved. Occasionally these cousins would carelessly marry and
        affect the genes. Alternatively, </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">would
        the stress from the pre-Civil War years have fired up an extra male
        bias? We know little of the society of that time. We know of only one fellow who departed the village for a few
        years and joined the Roundheads. He was <a href="../../Blands/Bland's&#32;Date&#32;Stone.htm"> Richard
        Bland</a>, the second eldest
        one of four sons (no daughters!) that were born from 1623 to 1632. He
        survived all the battles and returned with, eventually, a good pay that
        would have exceeded earnings possible in agriculture. Having three
        competing brothers perhaps had encouraged him to seek his fortune
        elsewhere. Could these conditions have
        encouraged a common male bias? The opinion of a geneticist is required.<o:p>

        </span>From 1790 onwards the social climate of Blisworth changed
        dramatically. After around 1650, farming was being gradually improved
        and <a href="../../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm"> transferred to only a few</a> favoured farmers. This created some
        poverty in the labouring class that is believed to have endured into the
        Victorian times.&nbsp; In the 1780s a clever
        farmer, <a href="../../Articles/Stone-works.html"> John Roper</a>, arrived from Suffolk with new ideas on grassland and
        arable fields and was awarded a plum job as agent to the Duke of
        Grafton. He was persuaded toward profiteering with the Duke’s capital,
        swindled everyone he could and was finally sacked in 1833. Alongside him
        was a new <a href="../../Articles/Ambrosse-2.htm"> Rector, Rev. Ambrosse</a>, who held the benefice from 1799 to
        1840. He was often absent from the Parish, gambled and found himself, on
        more than one occasion, in the debtors prison. Farmers and villagers
        alike experienced enormous disruption by a workforce building the canal
        and its tunnel through the parish. The wharf at Blisworth became,
        especially for 10 years or so, a busy transhipping port. The main road
        through the village was upgraded to a turnpike, costing more for anyone
        to move stock from field to field. By 1837 there was established an
        enormous embankment that seemed to cut the village off from the villages
        to the north. It was to carry the new London to Birmingham railway with
        a substantial station just outside the village limits. The stone quarry
        was enlarged by 1820 and new quarries for ironstone were being dug by
        1860.<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In the
        time interval of 70 years there was no longer a scarcity of new
        employment, or so it seemed, but the influx of newcomers to the village
        virtually doubled the population and doubled the birth rate. One can
        imagine a majority of society that was poor or in poverty looking on at
        the good fortune of a few lucky entrepreneurial people. The loss of
        a moral compass, hitherto set by a Rector and a few influential people,
        one supposes gave the community a sort of “go ahead”. The scale of illegitimacy
        took off and there was perhaps an enormous increase in male-male
        competition. The illegitimacy rate of 2 in 25 years that had been
        maintained for at least 200 years climbed to a level of nearly one per
        year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The claimed large
        flush of them at</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> the time of the
        canal building (1795 - 1810) was not noted in fact. The bar chart below,
        <b>
        Figure 2</b>, condenses the table opposite. Oddly, from 1854,
        there were no more illegitimacies recorded in the usual way. This was
        because of the move by Rev Barry to follow the CoE
        &quot;high-church&quot; fashion causing him to simply ban any use of the
        phrase &quot;base born&quot; from 1854. The chart is therefore continued
        with a different colour showing babies baptised with just a mother
        present. Maybe his ministry improved societal standards after ~1850
        because the chart does show a decline. Another factor was the new 1872
        law that made the father equally liable for the support of the
        illegitimate child and, incidentally called for the compulsory recording
        of all births.<o:p>

        besides Plowman achieved multiple illegitimacies.<o:p>

        created over-crowding. The railway company in circa 1850 built the
        twelve houses near the railway arch for their workers who were enjoying
        a fair to good income. There were 11 houses built ~1870 to
        a “Grafton design” that were intended for prosperous families. The baker R. Westley,
        however, built two blocks of tenements containing 28 poorly
        specified units for the poorer families in 1855 and also a few cottages
        for higher grade workers at
        Pynus in ~1890. The poor had the new tenement and and were crowded into
        them and the lower grade cottages, some of which were subdivided into 3
        or 4 units. Grafton, the owner of Blisworth till 1919, was
        criticised in <a href="../../Articles/village_house_famine.htm"> parliament in
        1911</a> for his derisory record in house
        building and it was not until the Towcester Rural District Council began
        razing old houses, in the name of public health, in the 1930s, building
        over 36 new Council houses, that the village could be said to be
        catching up on the population expansion. Crowding was pretty bad. The 1871 census
        demonstrates this and shows 952 people resident in 222 dwellings. The
        distribution of housing density has been determined from a knowledge of
        the size of the dwellings and the houses were divided into “classes”
        as HIGH, Good, Medium or Dire (or evidently Empty or &quot;residents not
        at home&quot;), see <b>Table IV</b> below.<o:p>

        &quot;Medium class&quot; and those described as &quot;Dire&quot; there
        were 25 dwellings with 6 or more occupants, up to a total of 10. The
        high apparent occupancy for the houses classed as &quot;HIGH&quot; is
        due to the fact that they included servants and a total number of
        bedrooms of around 6. Most of the units considered &quot;Medium or
        Dire&quot; comprised one bedroom, one shared living room, a shared
        kitchen area and maybe a shared &quot;copper&quot; for hot water (no
        bathroom, water from a well nearby). With that there would often be an
        outside closet toilet, emptied manually twice weekly, shared between 4
        to 6 households. Fresh tap-water and flush toilets arrived in the
        village in 1953 - 17 years after Northampton.<o:p></span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

        after nearly 100 years of grossly unhygienic use, it was perfectly
        reasonable for the Council to raze such “in-grained” houses and
        start again (though villagers with ideas of property development found
        the action of “replacing stone with utility brick” lamentable).<o:p>

        just before 1800 was hovering in a slight female-bias state, ie. <b>SRB</b>
        ~ 0.95, and this could have been because there was an under-current of
        male babies dying before they could be baptised. Quite why this ratio
        was overturned into a male-bias in the Victorian years is something of a
        mystery. Could there be a similar but diluted effect from male-male
        competition (compared to the 1600s) arising in the genetics of the
        community? At least comforting is the fact that from 1800 any suspicion
        of inter-breeding would be dispelled.<o:p>

        <font color="#000080">We should however look closely at the
        possibility of either infanticide or unrecorded family wasting being
        embedded in the figures. The 1871 census was used to analyse this issue
        along with the processed data for the 50-year period, 1850 – 1900. In
        that period there were 71 recorded deaths at an age less than 12 months
        and a further 74 for children under the age of 6 years. These two
        figures amount to a loss of 27% of all births (baptisms) and there were
        in fact 38% more recorded boy deaths than girls.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><font color="#000080">It
        is a fact that the SRB ratio for the Victorian period is anomalously
        high and demands to be explained. We have discussed crowding and poverty
        which were both undeniable factors influencing society in the Victorian era
        and alluded to a loss of moral compass (as against the standards at that
        time, it must be emphasised). Perhaps a level of unrecorded
        family wasting was the reason for a high <b> SRB</b> which basically is pointing
        to a moderate shortage of recorded female births. Incidently there is a
        study of the effects of poverty in a large Venzuelan population
        (catholic, probably mostly healthy 'moral compass') and there the <b> SRB</b>
        remained in the range 0.98 to 1.08 while correlations implying
        poverty-driven family size control were found. So this is the
        justification here of &quot;adjusting&quot; the statistics for Victorian
        Blisworth. If an arbitrary
        total of 106 infants <u>as unrecorded family wasting</u> (in 50 years)
        were to be added to the 71 infants statistic and notionally counted as
        births then, with a reasonable excess of girls over boys assumed in the
        wasting, the entered points in <b> Figure 1</b> above, for the 1850 –
        1900 period, would occupy the grey outlined positions shown there, with
        an <b>SRB</b> of 1.10. The change provides some improved conformity
        between the two plots but that is rather modest compared with an
        adjustment one would expect, naively, from a simple set of ideas. At
        least it is evident that an incidence of wasting may make an adjustment in
        the right direction but the level of wasting at 106 seems too high to be
        reasonable.<o:p>

        topic and, at first sight, merely an unimportant side issue. <b> Figure 3</b> shows the number of such baptisms by decade. There were
        only three cases before 1780 and so it is only necessary to cover the
        period from 1780 to 1930 (the records cease in 1922). The high level in
        the 1790s and the 1800s could be explained by a large number of
        temporary visitors, as families, to the village for the canal and tunnel
        construction. The tiny component for the 1920s was due to WWI and only
        three years being represented.

        <font color="#000080"><span style="font-size:
11.0pt">A background trend is perceived, starting
        at a very low level at 1800 and peaking at 1870. Why is there a peak
        just then? Why would visitors be interested in Blisworth with an
        absentee Rector for much of the 1820s and 1830s? The owner of the <a href="../../Blisworth&#32;Hotel/GF-hotel.htm"> Blisworth Gardens</a>
        and his attempt to establish a Victorian-style pleasure resort after 1845 based on the
        railway station is a plausible reason. As a majority of these visits
        were in the summertime (<b>Figure 3</b>), perhaps people arranged baptism as part of a
        family holiday. On the earlier topic of <b>SRB</b> ratios it is rather
        curious here that the 244 infants born to “visitors” should display an <b>SRB</b>
        = 1.05, which is <u> a normal figure</u> and markedly lower than the figure in
        <b>
        Figure 1</b> for the 1850-1900 50-year period, that being 1.177 for
        Blisworth. Admittedly the numbers of visiting baptisms is small but is
        it not very odd that such a sample from Victorian locations, some near
        and some far from Blisworth, should show a normal <b>SRB</b> while, over
        the same period, Blisworth's births should be ratio-ed anomalously? The assumptions made on the previous page in order to
        “adjust” that latter figure are therefore to be regarded as unsavoury and startling.

        successfully use the single bedroom. The danger from it is that too much
        laudanum (morphine) might be used and the child looses appetite and
        energy and may eventually die addicted. A Pharmacy Act in 1868 demanded
        that “Poison” be displayed and directed that pharmacies and not
        grocers would sell in future. A survey of the local newspaper, the
        Northampton Mercury, was made for the period 1860 to 1863 and the
        presentation of adverts on various narcotic syrups or pills was easy to
        find. For example, Dicey’s Bateman Pectoral Drops is a morphine
        containing cough remedy, as is Lambert’s Asthmatic Balsam.
        Interestingly, Dicey, as the owner of the newspaper, was subscribing to
        a marketing deal with Bateman and a “quack-doctor” website, see
        below, comments that the morphine content varies widely, deal to deal.<o:p></o:p>

        generally are deeply, emotionally invested in their children.
        Institutionalised practices prejudicing child survival have the
        advantage of interposing time and space between a treatment that
        enhances the probability of early death, and a child's actual death.
        Hence, the relationship between cause and effect can pass unperceived.
        For example, infection of a ritually-inflicted wound appears several
        days after the injury is incurred. In societies with no germ theory of
        disease, pathogenesis would not be attributed to un-sterile conditions
        but to other factors, such as imperfect performance of the ritual act or
        the malfeasance of witches or supernatural. Scrimshaw (1982) notes that
        seeking psychological distance through temporal and spatial distance
        figures even among infanticidal parents who often abandon rather than
        directly murder their children.<o:p>

        the reader that infanticide exists, and to argue that two of its
        potentially numerous functions arc (1) the limitation of population
        growth; and (2) the management of demographic structure by control of
        the sex ratio. The latter, it is suggested, results in selective female
        infanticide to compensate for universally higher male mortality in
        infancy and childhood, and may be implicated in the prevalence of
        systems of male preference.<o:p>

        infant mortality was the widespread practice of giving children
        narcotics, especially opium, to quieten them. At Id an ounce laudanum
        was cheap enough — about the price of a pint of beer — and its sale
        was totally unregulated until late in the century. The use of opium was
        widespread both in town and country. In Manchester, according to one
        account, five out of six working-class families used it habitually. One
        Manchester druggist admitted selling a half-gallon of Godfrey's Cordial
        (the most popular mixture, it contained opium, treacle, water, and
        spices) and between five and six gallons of what was euphemistically
        called &quot;quietness&quot; every week. In Nottingham one member of the
        Town Council, a druggist, sold four hundred gallons of laudanum
        annually. At mid-century there were at least ten proprietary brands,
        with Godfrey's Cordial, Steedman<sup>’</sup>s Powder, and the grandly
        named Atkinson's Royal Infants Preservative among the most popular. In
        East Anglia opium in pills and penny sticks was widely sold and opium
        taking was described as a way of life there. Throughout the Fens it was
        used in 'poppy tea,' and doctors there reported how the infants were
        wasted from it — 'shrank up into little old men', 'wizened like little
        monkeys' is the way they were described.<o:p>

        noted how children 'kept in a state of continued narcotism will be
        thereby disinclined for food, and be but imperfectly nourished. Marasmus,
        or inanitition, and death from severe malnutrition would result, but the
        coroner was likely to record the death as 'debility from birth,' or
        'lack of breast milk,' or simply 'starvation.'</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

        discovery was made. The bodies of newborn twins were found wrapped in a
        bloodstained petticoat and chemise in the front garden of a house at
        Pentridge Villas, Notting Hill. Mr Guazzaroni, the surgeon who conducted
        the post-mortem at the Kensington workhouse, found that the twins had
        died because of intentional suffocation and exposure. A verdict of
        wilful murder by persons unknown was returned at the coroner’s inquest
        but the twin’s mother was never traced. Infanticide was disturbingly
        common in Victorian Britain.[1] Lionel Rose estimates that of 113,000
        deaths of children under the age of one in 1864, 1,730 were due to
        ‘violence’ with only 192 of those being classified as homicides.
        Contemporaries maintained that Britain was suffering from an epidemic of
        child-killing blamed on ‘puerperal insanity’, a form of post-natal
        mania that accounted for as much as 15% of female asylum admissions in
        some years. [2]<b><o:p>

        of the House of Commons where Thomas Wakley, coroner, surgeon and MP
        shocked his audience by claiming that infanticide[3], ‘was going on to
        a frightful, to an enormous, a perfectly incredible extent.’[4]By the
        1860s, the problem was believed to have reached crisis proportions and
        figured as one of the great plagues of society, alongside prostitution,
        drunkenness and gambling. According to some experts, it was impossible
        to escape from the sight of dead infants’ corpses, especially in the
        capital, for they were to be found everywhere from interiors to
        exteriors, from bedrooms to train compartments. One observer commented
        that bundles are left lying about in the streets... the metropolitan
        canal boats are impeded, as they are tracked along by the number of
        drowned infants with which they come in contact, and the land is
        becoming defiled by the blood of her innocents. We are told by Dr
        Lankester that there are 12,000 women in London to whom the crime of
        child murder may be attributed. In other words, that one in every thirty
        women (I presume between fifteen and forty-five) is a murderess.[5]<o:p>

        has to creep into life in the midst of foes’.[6] At every new
        ‘epidemic’ of dead babies found abandoned on the streets of the
        capital, there was a public outcry focussed on society’s responses. In
        1870, in London, 276 infants were found dead in the streets and in 1895,
        this figure reached 231. For the <i>Ladies’ Sanitary Association</i>,

        the babies were illegitimate. However, pleading this form of temporary
        insanity when taken to court was frequently met with a sympathetic
        response from judges, despite the obvious suspicion that some cases were
        murders. The problem of infanticide was brought into strong focus by the
        case of Mary Newell.[8] Born in south Oxfordshire, Mary had been a
        servant since she was 16. Without work in the summer of 1857, aged 21,
        she travelled to Reading where she met as old acquaintance, poulterer
        William Francis who invited her for a drink at his house. Mary ended up
        pregnant and Francis showed no further interest in her. Although she
        soon found employment within two months she left and single, pregnant
        and unemployed and having failed to persuade Francis to marry her, she
        was admitted to Henley workhouse on 11 January 1858. In May she gave
        birth to a son, Richard and remained at the workhouse until August when
        she walked the eight miles to Reading to seek help from Francis who
        refused. Unclear what to do and confused, Mary wandered round all night
        and eventually she undressed her baby son, laid him by the bank of the
        Thames and let him roll in. <o:p>

        was believed that had he shown any willingness to help, the baby would
        not have died. Although he admitted his neglect at the trial, this did
        little to moderate local feeling and after the verdict he was attacked
        by a mob, beaten and left semi-naked, an event repeated when news of the
        trial’s outcome reached his new home at Wallingford. Mary was
        condemned to death but was in such a state that she was committed to the
        local asylum. A petition was launched asking Queen Victoria to commute
        her sentence and the local mayor, magistrates and nearly 800 others
        signed it. A deputation of people from Reading visited the Home Office
        to lobby and this intervention appears to have saved Mary’s life. <o:p>

        could be exposed to the full force of the law. Yet, on this politically
        delicate question, sentencing by the courts depended as much on the
        facts as on the medical interpretation placed on them. Victorian
        leniency towards infanticide was shaken in 1865 when a woman from
        London, Esther Lack, killed her three children by slitting their
        throats. After the court backed an insanity plea, one newspaper openly
        questioned the willingness of courts to find in favour of such
        defendants. Evidence from London shows that most women charged with
        infanticide between 1837 and 1913 were in their early to mid-20s though
        some were as young as 16 and that the younger the woman, the more likely
        she was to be acquitted or guilty only of the lesser offence of
        concealing a birth. However, it was not until the 1922 Infanticide Act
        that the death penalty was abolished for women who murdered their
        newborn babies if is could be shown that the woman in question had had
        her balance of mind disturbed as a direct result of giving birth. <o:p>

        for murder but in particular infanticide. Arsenic poisoning was
        difficult to identify since its symptoms were similar to those of
        dysentary, gastritis and other causes of natural death and magistrates
        were generally unwilling to squander public funds while the chances of
        detection were so small.[9] Families could enrol their children in a
        ‘burial club’ for a halfpenny a week and when the child died the
        club would pay out as much as £5 towards funeral expenses. Since a
        cheap funeral cost around £1, this left a valuable surplus for feeding
        the remaining children and some families enrolled each child in several
        clubs to increase the payout. There was a saying in Manchester, though
        it existed across the country that a burial-club baby was unlikely to
        survive for long. The burial-club scandal became so widespread that
        legislation was passed in 1850 prohibiting insuring children under 10
        for more than £3. However, the lure of life insurance remained a potent
        cause of infanticide. Mary Ann Cotton, a former school teacher from
        County Durham murdered most of her 15 children and step-children, as
        well as her mother, three husbands and her lodger, before she was hanged
        in 1873. <o:p>

        professional baby farmer found guilty of infanticide. One of the first
        and most sensational trials was that of Margaret Waters, the so-called
        ‘Brixton Baby Farmer’ in 1870, who was found guilty of conspiracy to
        obtain money by fraud and the murder of a baby.[10] She was executed
        amid extensive popular agitation and press coverage. In a sense the
        pattern had been set and when, in 1879, Annie Took was similarly found
        guilty of smothering and dismembering an illegitimate physically
        handicapped child she had been paid £12 to look after, she too was
        executed. Other high-profile baby farmers such as the Edinburgh
        murderess Jessie King in 1887[11] and Amelia Dyer[12] suffered a similar
        fate. Yet not all of these criminals were sentenced to death and other
        cases that received front-page coverage such as those of Catherine
        Barnes and Charlotte Winsor resulted in verdicts of life imprisonment. <o:p>

        was a crime committed primarily by women and, more often than not, by
        the mothers or the surrogate mothers of the infants themselves.
        Undoubtedly, the more ‘acceptable’ of these two explanations was the
        latter, that these crimes were the work of depraved, unscrupulous women
        who had lost all sense of their maternal instincts and indulged in a
        commercial trade with life itself inside a profession known popularly as
        ‘baby farming’.[13] The term first appeared in <i>The Times</i> in
        the late 1860s, and, according to one medical practitioner of the
        period, was coined ‘to indicate the occupation of those who receive
        infants to nurse or rear by hand for a payment in money, either made
        periodically (as weekly or monthly) or in one sum’.[14] It was
        regarded with a great deal of suspicion in many quarters, as an
        “occupation which shuns the light”[15] and not simply a primitive
        form of child-care. However, its popular appeal and social function were
        immense at a time when illegitimacy was stigmatised and single mothers
        excluded from the most elementary means of supporting their child. <o:p>

        system had become well established. The ‘baby farmer’ was usually a
        woman of a mature age and poor working-class background who would offer
        either to look after the ‘unwanted’ child or ensure that it was
        ‘passed on’ to suitable adoptive parents. The fee for this
        transaction varied according to the specifics of the contract but was
        usually situated between £7 and £30.[16] In the majority of cases
        there was also a tacit understanding between the two parties that, in
        the harsh conditions of life in working-class areas of the nation’s
        cities, the child’s chances of survival would be extremely slim. What
        particularly outraged public feeling was that this trade had a visible,
        almost respectable, side to it for it was practised openly through
        advertising, in national, regional and local newspapers. Not
        surprisingly under such circumstances, the financial considerations
        involved in this extensive traffic in infant life gradually became the
        focus of deep suspicion. For the <i>British Medical Journal </i>of 1868,
        these ‘baby farmers’ would not have the slightest difficulty in
        disposing of any number of children, so that they may give no further
        trouble, and never be heard of, at £10 a head.[17]<o:p>

        infanticide’, a convenient way for women to solve the problem of
        unwanted and illegitimate births. It was, for instance, widely believed
        that these babies were often left to wilt away and die, sometimes helped
        along with a little soother known as ‘Kindness’. These rumours found
        credence in the fact that at this time it was common practice, not only
        among those whose looked after children, but also among mothers
        themselves, to use a certain ‘Godfrey’s Cordial’ to quieten the
        babies, and that this, if dosed incorrectly, could lead to ‘the sleep
        of death’.[18]<o:p>

        trade. <i>The Times </i>had no doubts that the women who sent their
        children to baby farmers were <i>‘complicitous and selfish’</i> and
        not naive and impoverished victims in their own right.[19] Yet a survey
        of those implicated in the more spectacular trials of the period
        suggests that most were guilty only of the crime of having a child
        outside of wedlock. Crime reports invariably refer to the biological
        mothers’ occupation as that of bar-maid, prostitute, factory or mill
        worker, domestic servant. Much more rarely are there references to
        ‘outraged’ middle-class girls and unfaithful upper-class women
        having recourse to the infamous baby farmers. In the Margaret Waters
        case, for instance, the court heard of 17-year-old Jeanette Cowen, who
        had been raped by the husband of a friend and, on the birth of her son,
        her father arranged ‘adoption’ procedures with Waters without the
        mother’s consent.&nbsp; Evelina Marmon, a barmaid from Bristol,
        confided her 10-month-old child to the safe keeping of Amelia Dyer
        because she was temporarily unable to look after it. She was unaware
        that the baby had been strangled and disposed of until the trial, as
        Dyer sent her regular reports about its progress. The illegitimate child
        of Elizabeth Campbell, who died in childbirth, was ‘adopted’ for a
        generous fee by Jessie King to avoid a family scandal but nobody
        apparently suspected that any harm would befall the child. <o:p>

        sustained pressure of such groups as the <i>Infant Life Protection
        Society</i> that called for the registration and control of all people
        in charge of babies on a professional basis.[20] Not only was this
        activity an integral part of the social regulation of the nation’s
        sexuality, it also fulfilled a valuable economic role by allowing
        working-class women to occupy paid employment. Government interference
        in such a private sphere was therefore problematic in the extreme. The
        breakthrough only came through a private member’s initiative which
        became the <i>Infant Life Protection Act</i> in 1872. This reform made
        registration obligatory with the local authority for any person taking
        in two or more infants under one year of age for a period greater than
        24 hours. Furthermore, deaths of infants in such care had to be
        communicated to the Coroner within 24 hours. It was a timid start since
        the scope of people exempted from the Act was significant; relatives,
        day-nurses, hospitals and even foster women were all excluded and no
        ‘authentification’ of contracts between parent and baby farmer was
        required. Moreover since the registration of all births, live and dead
        did not become compulsory until 1874, unless the authorities actually
        knew that a baby had been born, it was possible for it to die, be killed
        or be disposed of without anyone even noticing its existence. Only after
        other sensational ‘epidemics’ of infanticide in the ensuing years
        did a further <i>Infant Life Protection Act</i> force its way through
        Parliament in 1897. This Act finally empowered local authorities to
        control the registration of “nurses” responsible for more than one
        infant under the age of five for a period longer than 48 hours.[21]<o:p>

        episode of mania similar to that suffered by manic depressives. Patients
