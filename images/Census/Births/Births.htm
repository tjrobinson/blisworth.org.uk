      a March 2014 meeting of the Blisworth Heritage Society a presentation was made
      on the study of data from the Church Registry of births, deaths and
      marriages - actually Baptisms, Burials and Marriages. The registry has
      been maintained since 1550. Below is displayed some of the more
      fascinating data sheets presented at that meeting. Included was the fact
      that between 1548 and 1922 there were 2603 boys baptised and 2284 girls.
      The ratio of boys to girls was thus 1.14 and not the figure normally
      expected for a modern society which would be 1.00 to 1.07.</font></p>
