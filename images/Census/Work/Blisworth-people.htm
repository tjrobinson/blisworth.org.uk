        <p><font color="#000080">This is the product of meticulous work that
        began with Robin Freeston collecting data into MS XL charts from the UK
        census records between 1841 and 1901. All three authors then formulated
        a way in which the data would be best presented and Robin created the
        charts that were used in a MS Powerpoint presentation given by Hilary
        Spurrier and Beryl Andrews to a Friday meeting of the Heritage Society.
        The charts were later edited by Tony Marsh so that they could be
        incorporated more easily into a web-page.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080">As first posted on this website in May 2013, the document
        had
        notes alongside most charts which corresponded with the 'bullet points'
        used in the presentation. As time goes by (we may expect months to elapse)
        the textual content will be enhanced according to inputs from the
        authors. Hypertext links may appear also.</font></p>

         <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"> Farming was central to Blisworth in the 19th Century and very
         labour intensive. The impact of mechanisation was only felt late in the
         century. The agricultural depression of the 1880s did not affect
         employment in Blisworth.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><font color="#000080">Originally
        there were 7 farm houses in the centre of the village but after
        inclosure was completed in 1815, there were 5 new farm houses built on
        the periphery, surrounded by their new lands – Hill Farm, Lodge Farm,
        Tunnel Hill Farm, Blisworth Hill Farm and Glebe Farm.</font></p>

        76 in mid C18 to 175 by 1841 mainly by large cottages and old farmhouses

        Courteenhall Road, Stoke Road, and Chapel Lane and in 1890s the terrace
        by the Sun Moon &amp; Stars with 4 cottages at the rear. All were

        first tollhouse was in the High Street at the corner of Church Lane - a
        later one was built near the railway arch. Toll collectors George Pacey
        in 1851 and Benjamin Woodhouse in 1861 were also shoe makers. Thomas<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Workers</b></span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Most workers are boat hands or
        boat captains (33 in 1861). Leggers were listed only in 1851 and 1861
        because they were replaced by steam tugs used to pull boats through the
        tunnel, in the interests of safety. Did the railway &quot;kill&quot; the
        canal?</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><font color="#000080">By
        1827 “leggers” had to be registered – 12 at each end of the tunnel.
        They could only work in one direction and had to return to their village
        carrying their boards. They were replaced by steam propulsion which was
        introduced&nbsp; c1860. The journey through the canal was regularised
        using steam tugs after a fatal accident in 1865 and this became a
        regular service until c1935.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080">The London to Birmingham line
        opened in 1838 and the link to Northampton and Peterborough was opened

        <p><font color="#000080">The railways was a major employer, 17 living in
        Blisworth in 1851, 62 in 1881. Many workers came in from other areas as
        far afield as London or Birmingham for a steady uniformed job. The 12
        Railway cottages were built in 1840s and let to workers.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080">Both Limestone and Ironstone were
        quarried and the evidence is in the cottage walls of Blisworth.
        Quarriers were major employers; Duke of Grafton for limestone and
        various entrepreneurs for ironstone. Occasionally the quarry manager
        might be also a part-time farmer, eg. Sam Montgomery for Grafton in
        1871.</font></p>

        quarries opened by the Duke of Grafton to provide work for men returning
        from the Napoleonic wars after 1815 and the Stone Works building in
        Stoke Road was built in c1835. The Grafton Villas in Station Road was
        built in 1840 to showcase the local stone.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><font color="#000080">Ironstone
        quarrying began in 1852 and continued until 1967. Only three ironstone
        labourers were listed in 1861 rising to 27 in 1881 but many workers
        walked in from other villages as far as Alderton.</font></p>
