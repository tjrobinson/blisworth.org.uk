        <p><font color="#000080">This is the product of meticulous work that
        began with Robin Freeston collecting data into MS XL charts from the UK
        census records between 1841 and 1901. All three authors then formulated
        a way in which the data would be best presented and Robin created the
        charts that were used in a MS Powerpoint presentation given by Hilary
        Spurrier and Beryl Andrews to a Friday meeting of the Heritage Society.
        The charts were later edited by Tony Marsh so that they could be
        incorporated more easily into a web-page.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080">As first posted on this website in May 2013, the document
        had
        notes alongside most charts which corresponded with the 'bullet points'
        used in the presentation. As time goes by (we may expect months to elapse)
        the textual content will be enhanced according to inputs from the
        authors. Hypertext links may appear also.</font></p>

          cottages in the 1840s, in the 1860s a grocer store (Young's), the
          Mount Pleasant four cottages and the cottages next to the store. The
          Wesleys Buildings in Stoke Road were described as new in 1871. In the
          1880s 27-31 of the High Street older cottages were replaced and the
          semi-detached cottages in Stoke Road were built. In
          the 1880s cottages were built by the &quot;Chapel&quot; between the
          chapel and the canal in Chapel Lane and in the 1890s the cottages
          around The Sun Moon and Stars were built by Phipps.</font>
