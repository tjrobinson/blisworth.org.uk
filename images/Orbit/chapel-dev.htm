        25, 2012</b>&nbsp; Work began clearing the old barns, their concreted floors and the large concrete
        buried box that once served as a sewage settling tank for the village in
        c.1900. An immense quantity of very black soil was collected towards the south end of the site.
        This was probably the cesspit contents reverted to rich soil over 100 years.  It was
        also probably the homes of dozens of rats that formed a rather
        frightening brief plague in Pond Bank, Chapel Lane and parts of the High Street.

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Detailed
        plans had been lodged against the outline planning application that
        showed that <a href="../New&#32;Houses/21Cplanning.htm#matchbox">Matchbox
        Architects</a> was merely a company used to create schematic layouts -
        elevations that looked quite good and matched other nearby houses (in
        Chapel Lane) were in evidence so that aspect of the project seemed
        promising but there was still some doubt about hazards associated with
        the junction of the new road (dubbed Mill Stream Close in a <b>PC</b>
        meeting) and the existing Chapel lane at a point where the latter has a
        grade of 1:6.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><br>
        <br>
        A very large pile of broken concrete was created with a stone crusher.  Said crusher closed
        Chapel Lane for an hour or two one day and was the source of a major news "flash".  The
        stone was situated at the lower end of the future temporary road and therefore much more would<br>
        have to be lorried in to make the road. This temporary road, connecting
        with the Northampton Road was negotiated quite early on to alleviate any
        disruption to traffic in the village, especially in Chapel Lane. After that&nbsp; broken concrete was removed a few weeks later there was
        speculation that the Northampton Road access might not come to pass and
        even as late as May 2012 there was no encouraging news.

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        rest of the year just passes by with no news on the project. The farmer
        meanwhile resumed use of the upper field for beef but the introduction
        of store lambs was not attempted.</span></font></p>

        The company resubmitted their entire plans (for full planning permission
        rather than in outline) and managed to increase the
        average size of the houses by at least half-a-bedroom. They confessed
        they were experiencing a financial squeeze on the project and needed to
        maximised value and &quot;turn a nett loss into a hoped for small
        profit&quot; - these guys! The &quot;accessories&quot; (106 terms) that
        they agreed to were a Northampton Road access, a pedestrian crossing
        near the school, a pavement on the north side of the Chapel Lane for
        pedestrian access and some community support yet to be evaluated but
        appeared to include both a tennis and badminton court.</font></p>

        </o:p><b>July 1, 2013</b>&nbsp; The first definite signs of building
        activity appeared with
        some plant quietly moved in during the weekend. Orbit now have a tiny
        encampment with an office, a chemical toilet and 3 or so machines. They have begun to level the
        site and have built some brickwork and stonework samples near to the entrance to
        the field for the public and councillors to inspect. Note that the camera position
        for the larger image was in the centre of a cluster of affordable houses
        - there will be a total of eleven of them.

        While the profiling of earth levels continues, with the foreman
        occasionally trying to evict the geese who seem quite defiant, we learn that
        all may not be well for the immediate future. The developers have never
        shown any enthusiasm with the idea of a &quot;haulage access road&quot;
        forged through the top field from the Northampton Road. Despite the need
        for one, for the sake of less village damage and disruption, being
        agreed at the outline planning stage and at the stage when Orbit took on
        the full application it turns out that the <b> NCC</b> Highways department and
        the Health and Safety Executive have expressed a strong reluctance to
        sanction the arrangement. With pretty much no consideration for the
        villagers, the <b> PC</b> have been sent a planning document for the project, as
        approved by &quot;all&quot; but for the <b>PC</b>'s opportunity to comment etc.,
        with the provision of a haulage route already deleted. An apparently
        independent consultant came
        along to the last <b> PC</b> meeting and tried to explain the problems. It has
        to be said that he was totally unconvincing on the point that a
        Northampton Road haulage access was unfeasible (read &quot;too
        costly&quot;?). The <b> NCC</b> councillor present at the meeting undertook to
        arrange a site meeting as soon as possible and we await a final sensible solution. The
        prospect of hundreds of lorry deliveries via Chapel Lane is thought to be totally
        unacceptable on account mainly of the narrowness of the roads and the
        presence of parked cars belonging to residents for whom there are no
        off-road drives or garages.&nbsp; <b>September 3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The site meeting was arranged with alacrity and saw the <b>NCC</b>
        explaining their concerns in a gentle way that did not, after all,
        preclude haulage access from the Northampton Road.&nbsp; The earlier
        introduction of <b>HSE</b> concerns was said to be spurious. An
        alternative access via the pony paddock off Station Road was tabled and
        this idea, surprisingly, attained the status of a real option after
        involving the landowners. The <b>PC</b> thus stand their ground and
        Orbit considers its options in this battle. <b>November 4 </b> Orbit
        seemed to be engaged in other matters, for simply no progress has been
        seen on any issue on this topic, indeed the heavy plant has been removed
        with what appears to be a substantial amount of earth-moving yet to be
        done.&nbsp; Hmm . . .</font>
        </p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>March 2014</b>&nbsp; There has been no
        progress to report - nothing on the Northampton Road access, the Village
        Zebra Crossing or any sign of returning to create drains and levels.
        This application may need extending before March 2016 as the work done
        so far might not constitute &quot;a start to the development&quot;.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>May 2015</b>&nbsp; We now hear, through a
        channel we can firmly believe, that Orbit have become discouraged by the
        evident costs of the project, especially the need for the access road,
        and that they are endeavouring to sell the whole plot. </font>
