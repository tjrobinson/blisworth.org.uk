        </span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Whilst
      the arrival of the SMJ railway* inconvenienced the earliest ironstone

      the miners made good use of the railway to ship out the ore. </span></font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In recent discussions with Barry Taylor, author of an emerging book on
        the SMJ railway,
        the question was raised regarding the location of the extremely
        distinctive ironstone off-loading
        installation depicted in the website photograph <b>18-09 </b>and also shown here in the inset. It
        shows that the stages involved in the
        off-loading were to (a) position horse and cartload of stone in the box at
        road level (horse to the right), (b) open a hatch and the side of the cart
        to let sufficient load down into a trolley-wagon running on a level set
        of rails, (c) roll the trolley to its limit of travel and open its end
        (and maybe tilt it) to (d) facilitate it being emptied into a chute over a rail wagon
        waiting at a siding to the main SMJ line.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">There
        are two ways to determine which of the four bridges that cross the
        Gayton parish cutting must have hosted this off-load installation. One
        is to consider the evident geometry in the photograph with some
        broad-brush dimensions extracted from the on-line Government Lidar survey data.
        The other is to simply walk through the entire cutting examining and
        photographing all four bridges from both sides - this proved to be very difficult and for some views impossible because of the virulent ivy
        which has covered the bridge parapets and facings.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>Bridges</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The
        bridges are highlighted in red in an inset below. Working towards the south:<br>
        1. A road bridge near the station, demolished and irrelevant.<br>
        2.
        Gayton - Blisworth road bridge. [It is actually labelled No. 3 in paint
        at track level]<br>
        3. Public footpath bridge (&quot;Oxenfordwey&quot;) running east from <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/Review/snakemore.htm"> Gayton Wilds</a> farm (which is
        now a
        small estate of four or five private houses).<br>
        4. Private farmers bridge - a facility for Mr. Darker (c.1860) whose
        field was divided into two parts.<br>
        5. <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/Review/snakemore.htm">Saltway</a> bridge - a road bridge continuing a re-routed connection
        between Tiffield and Gayton, also crossed by the Saltway.</span></font></p>

        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In the
        historical records there is already evidence of a shoot (sic.) being
        once installed at road bridge No. 2. Only the box for the cart is shown in
        this diagram, arrowed in blue in the inset. The plan, dated 1905, was mainly to convey early 20th century changes to the
        tramway, blue crayon, that lies to the west of the cutting. It was copied and
        supplied by Barry Taylor. Perhaps this chute is the same one as depicted
        above but first consider the dimensions of the four bridges, as
        indicated in the Lidar imagery..</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">So for this
        &quot;shoot&quot; to work,
        an additional wooden chute would have been used which could connect the
        off-load arrangement at the top of the embankment with the wagons waiting
        below in a siding. If placed by any one of the 3 span bridges then it would have been about
        20 metres long and sloped at about 30 degrees. No chute by bridge No.
        2&nbsp; is shown in the plan and so was perhaps taken away by 1905.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">All
      the bridges with the exception of the private bridge No. 4 are similarly
      proportioned. The private bridge is located where the track is
      substantially level, ie. reached its maximum height before descending
      towards Tiffield at a point where the depth of excavation was at a
      minimum. A significant cutting,
      excavated by hand and barrow, extends for over a mile and this probably
      presented a problem regarding where the spoil needed to be taken.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Geometry</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Photograph <b>18-09</b> tells us that the short
      piece of railway for the transfer trolley is near the same level as the
      camera lens. Given the man in the picture was about 1.8 metres tall, one can estimate
      that the road level is approximately 4 to 4.2 metres above the short
      rails. The camera tripod would be 1.5 to 1.9 metres high and standing
      firmly perhaps on a wagon floor which would be another metre from the
      track. These estimates yield a bridge height, road to track-bed, of 6.8 +/-
      0.3 metres (and
      if the camera had been placed on the ground at more-or-less track level, this
      would bring the estimate down to only ~6 metres) suggesting bridge No. 4
      as the likely location. Bearing in mind however that the
      angle subtended between the axis of the camera and either the bridge face or the track must have
      been in the region of 45° and knowing that common cameras c. 1900 could
      accommodate a field of view normally ranging over only from 25° to 50° the inevitable
      'conclusion' must
      be that, for bridges Nos. 2,&nbsp; 3 and 5, the camera would have been floating in
      midair !</font>
      <p><font color="#000080"><b>Expedition</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      First the bridges Nos. 2 and 5 were inspected at road level to help
      determine &quot;where would the camera be located&quot; and make some
      assessment of brick facings and copings. Then an outing, starting from the stairs at bridge No. 5, confirmed that No.5
      was never the host for the chute installation because of brick and coping
      stones style and the fact that the side arch was much further away from
      the boundary of the cutting. Bridge No.4 was a reasonably close match at
      first sight. Some aspects of the brickwork on the north face matched well but it was
      largely covered in trailing ivy. The face was photographed but attempts made to achieve a good schematic fit with the
      historical image were unsuccessful. Brickwork colour (courses of black brick), copings and
      the shape of the arch were also a poor match. It seemed likely the brickwork
      was the original but the coping was built with corbel black bricks
      rather than slabs. The main problem in achieving a good match was because
      the single arch was very broadly elliptical.</font></p>
      <p><img src="Chutes&#32;and&#32;bridges.jpg" align="left" height="449" width="286">
      <font color="#000080">Therefore
      my verdict was open until I could prepare an 8&quot; shaving mirror
      attached with its swivel onto a 2 metre pole to enable a close examination
      of brickwork from above at the heads of the side arches in the 3
      span configurations.&nbsp;There is no doubt at all that the verdict is the <b>18-09</b>
      installation was definitely at bridge No.2, just where it is drawn on the north
      side in the 1904 plan shown above. The
      camera
      angle relative to the bridge face was re-estimated to be about 37° when it was realised the bridge and its arch were considerable
      foreshortened. This had caused confusion over the horizontal distances between
      features. Referring to the diagram at the end of this article, the
      position and appearance of items A,C and D were in good accord. It appears
      that the parapet was rebuilt at some stage because the degree of
      out-sailing of courses at the base of the parapet was not a good match.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">R</font><font color="#000080">egarding the camera
      position one must conclude that the stanchions or the struts for the wooden tramway
      bridge must have provided support at about the right height and that the
      photographer must have had access to a very long lens tube and struck lucky in
      regards to catching the dog 'frozen' enough for the inevitable long exposure. It is a shame the photographer did not record the
      rest of the chute
      and the equipment at track level that would have been necessary to control
      the energy of the descending rocks.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Other points are made in the <b>Appendix</b>.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Chutes</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Finally we turn to a review of all the known off-load-to-railway installations along
      this cutting and the situation is shown in this third inset, based on OS
      1899. Working from
      north to south each chute is identified by date (plans were kindly
      supplied by Brian Taylor):<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>1905</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; a Wheldon application was to connect the tramway to the
      main line for the installation originally set up by George Pell, as
      mentioned above.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>&quot;1885&quot; - </b><i>the date signifies 1865 - 1900</i>. This is the
      &quot;shoot&quot;, probably for Pell, marked at bridge 2 that has turned
      out to be the subject shown in image <b>18-09</b>. It is drawn
      incompletely in the 1905 plan, therefore assumed in disuse by then
      although sidings on the <b> west</b> side are still in evidence in the
      1905 plan.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>1888</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; an application for sidings on the <b> east</b> side
      includes an indication for a chute as marked which one assumes served the
      mining in the adjacent field (with/without a tramway?). Sidings on both sides of the main
      line are unlikely and it is probable that the north end of the siding did
      not actually reconnect with the main line. Interestingly, Tonks (p. 35)
      records that a later use of this off-load location was agreed with T. &amp;
      I. Bradley (Darlaston) in 1912 and included a proposal to quarry a massive 200 acres
      but nothing came
      of the proposal. It serves to illustrate the 'state of flux' in ironstone
      mining that is now difficult to document.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>1881</b>&nbsp; another Wheldon application for sidings on the west side
      but showing no
      chute. Note that one of Tonk's maps show tramway sidings running near the
      cutting at this approximate location and a map referring to Wheldon's
      mining shows a tramway running close to the main line with a chute also
      marked. This
      is quite near to bridge No. 4 but not adjacent to it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>Finally &quot;?&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; At a short distance north of bridge No.
      5, there is some striking embankment disturbances that might have accommodated a
      chute. It is on the <b>west</b> side and marked in the inset plan at the
      point where Lidar indicate the disturbance. Perhaps
      this feature was connected with the management of spoil. Also notable
      in the Lidar data is a large 2 to 3 metre high embankment in the fields on
      both sides of the railway, between bridges Nos. 4 and 5. It is assumed
      this is spoil from the original 1860s railway excavation and perhaps
      intentionally limited to a
      collection of potentially
      useful iron-ore, with other burdens discarded. One might
      surmise that a possible chute here could have been used, at least
      initially, by the mining concerns to recover that iron-ore and send it
      north by railway. The existence of normal surface mining work in this
      southerly field has not been noted by Tonks. The landowner (The Darker
      family)
      recorded a feature labelled &quot;Old Spoil Bank&quot; on their estate map
      (1791) when it was updated in red ink to show the line of the railway but
      shows no access from the fields.</font>
      <p><img src="gantry.jpg" align="left" height="117" width="406">
      <span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Whilst
      the arrival of the SMJ railway considerably inconvenienced the surface
      miners, it is clear that for a period that eventually extended to ~1950s
      the miners made good use of the railway in order to trans-ship to either the
      Grand Junction Canal or to the Birmingham to London main line. Records
      show that the relatively audacious overhead tramway used to work fields to
      the east just north of bridge No. 2 was in fact in place <u> before</u> the
      SMJ railway cutting was made. George Pell's sidings beneath that gantry
      once led to a tramway that served a siding beside the main line (a mile
      away). That tramway had to be
      moved to the west, out of the way of the cutting. Also, the gantry had to be
      rebuilt to cross the SMJ cutting, which is around 35 - 40 metres wide. The inset perhaps helps to visualise a timber construction
      using beams of up to 10 metres long. It was burnt down in 1929.</span></font></span></p>

      lens.</font>

      bridge details are traced with coloured shapes in a separate Photoshop
      level and this level is then applied to the historical picture. All the
      details were <u>in one geometrical plane</u> and so neither
      of the 'vantage point' details, mentioned above, would have challenged the
      ability to morph the bridge details to fit the historical picture. It would
      appear that the parapet has been rebuilt 4 or 5 brick courses higher, the
      brickwork reveal was rebuilt nearly a metre towards the bridge centre
      and evidently there has been modifications to provide a more substantial buttress.
      All of this work was done once the loading &quot;box&quot; had been removed. Anyone
      reading this might be unconvinced and suspect the &quot;right bridge&quot;
      has not been found. There is only bridge No. 3 (Gayton Wilds) left to inspect
      in a thorough manner but it is
      covered in ivy (see <a href="view&#32;S,&#32;bridge3sm.jpg">view to the south</a>
      at bridge 3) and there is an even poorer chance of obtaining a
      interpretable shot
      through the opposite bank hedge. If there is a bid for this work I can
      help with a map and a mirror!</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">I
      am forced to conclude that I was
      right in the first place: the camera was an ordinary one and was really in &quot;mid-air&quot; and
      there must have been a wooden bridge temporarily set across the cutting
      (perhaps part of the tramway bridge structure) on which the photographer
      could have stood. Basically, the <b> 18-09</b> picture has too much perspective
      slanting of level lines for it to have been taken with a long lens.</font>
