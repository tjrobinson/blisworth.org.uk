        </font></span><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The


        village church records, as a series of volumes, was placed in the care


        of the conservatory department at the Northampton Records Office (<b>NRO</b>) in approximately 1960.&nbsp; The


        son of the Rector at the time, a Mr. Jonathan Bunker, worked with a


        villager, Mrs. Eileen Rose, who helped with translations of the earliest


        entries from Latin script, to produce a series of sheets which were


        printed into the books that are now available to any member of the


        public at the <b>NRO</b>.&nbsp; We are very grateful for the work done


        by these two people which has resulted in accessible copies of the


        records.&nbsp; This page aims to make the information from


        those books available as PDF files.&nbsp; These files may be


        electronically searched for


        names thus providing an important service to family researchers.</span></font></p>


        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">There


        have been two initiatives towards a successful digitisation once it was


        realised that some files from the original work were on computer media


        that is now unreadable.&nbsp; The first was in


        2006, when all the individual pages of the records were scanned to


        create high quality jpeg images.&nbsp; These were then processed in OCR software and


        formatted for MSWord.&nbsp; The 'Word' files have been used as a search


        base to assist enquiries from the public made through this website since that date.&nbsp; The


        second, in 2011/12 by Robin Freeston, was to copy by hand using a


        laptop at the <b>NRO</b> the whole of the records into MSExcel files; this latter activity carried out


        unfortunately without the knowledge that the first had been done.&nbsp;


        Notwithstanding that point, the entire records formatted in Excel offers


        advanced features for search and data sorting - indeed for checking the


        integrity of the 2006 data processing.</span></font></p>


        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Here


        the 'Word' files from the first initiative have been merged, where


        possible, and made


        available, reformatted as PDF files.&nbsp; Regarding records for births


        (baptisms or christenings), marriages and deaths (burials), the


        partition of the original records into books, which changed through the near five


        centuries of recording, is reflected in the five bars shown in the


        diagram below - each bar corresponds to a file which can be


        downloaded.&nbsp; To inspect a file simply click on a bar and if you need the info again
        
        
        you will need to save to 'pdf' format on your computer and perhaps return to this page.</span></font></p>


        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The


        arrangement of the columns (ie. the precise tabulation) from page to


        page of the original documents was not found to be consistent.&nbsp; This was due to


        limitations of the OCR software but does not detract from the usefulness


        of the files.&nbsp; There may be occasional mistakes made by the OCR


        process due to blemished characters on the original.&nbsp; Some


        abbreviations are commonplace: <i>d</i> = daughter, <i>s</i> = son, <i>w</i>


        or <i>wid</i> = widow, <i>wr </i>or <i> widr&nbsp;</i> = widower, <i>sp</i> = spinster, <i>bach</i> = bachelor, <i>otp</i>


        = 'of this parish' and <i>inf</i> = infant.&nbsp; In using the files to


        search for names no problems are anticipated but, in some places, the


        records are not listed in exact date order.&nbsp; Therefore, in a search


        around a <u>particular date</u>, the user is advised to sweep through a


        small number of adjacent pages to find all parts of that year.</span></font></p>


        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Some


        of the records at the <b>NRO</b> are complete to dates as late as 1970 but are here


        truncated to


        the year 1922.&nbsp; This is at slight variance with the National Census


        policy on data protection but at least the website will be in reasonable harmony for the


        next 15 years or so and researchers can look for details over the war years


        1914-18 and through the Grafton Estate sale in 1919.&nbsp;&nbsp;In due


        course my successor may be reminded to extend the date of the truncation


        to


        ~1945.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
