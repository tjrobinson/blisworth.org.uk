        notes are of value in terms of a picture that one may develop, close to
        matters involving the church, of life in the village from about 1780 to
        1948.&nbsp; George's talent was to cover many human details that some
      historians might overlook, or simply be unaware of.&nbsp; The whole series
        was edited in two parts.&nbsp; The first in MS Word format and the
        second transferred to HTML so that hyperlinks to the remainder of the
        website could be formed.&nbsp; The whole amounts to a 64000 word
      rambling essay.&nbsp; It was meant to be read in small doses and now,
      collected together, it may be used in that way but also used as a
      reference source as useful as there is skill in picking the best key
      search-words.</font>
        <p style="padding-left: 100; padding-right: 100" align="left"><font color="#000080">The
        number at the beginning of some text paragraphs below is the issue number of
        George's Notes.&nbsp; The assemblage of notes are divided into the years
        of their writing from 1963 to 1975, approximately 12 to 13 notes each
        year.&nbsp; Below there are hyperlinks to the issues and the year of
        writing.&nbsp; An incompleted link implies that the issue is missing.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100; padding-right: 100" align="left"><font color="#000080">In fact,
        some of the first part is the
        less interesting as it goes over material about the physical features of
        the church and churchyard which are mostly <a href="../church_history.htm">present
        on the website already</a>.&nbsp; The reader is recommended to begin at
        issue no. 57 for an interesting &quot;rector-by-rector&quot; historical
        account of the church and village.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100; padding-right: 100" align="left"><font color="#000080">The second part is transcribed using scanner and OCR software, being a process that will generate a few
        unedited spelling slips, for which I apologise.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100; padding-right: 100" align="left"><font color="#000080">Note
        there is <a href="Notes/Index.doc">a helpful index</a> for the entire

        As
        I remarked in the October notes, the Rev. John Ambrose, who came to
        Blisworth in 1797, had much to occupy his time. Apart from the affairs
        of the village, he had concern for some of his parishioners who were
        away on Militia duties. The Parish Constable had already completed the
        census of all men available for the Militia: the Rector and his
        Wardens were responsible for the cash payments to the wives and families
        of the serving men.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">One man called
        away during this period of the Napoleonic war was John, a member of the
        ancient Gibbs family. His wife and three children received an allowance
        of 2/6d. each per week,&nbsp; (At
        this time a ploughman's wages were 6/0d. per week, and his working year
        was fifty-two weeks.&nbsp; Eggs were 6d, per score, beef and mutton.
        4d. per lb., a goose was 3/6d. and a hen could be bought for l/1d.)
        Many a family was unable to pay for the burial of their loved ones -
        these were buried &quot;on the Parish&quot; together with the dreaded
        word &quot;Pauper&quot; alongside their name in the Burial Register.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">Then there was
        the Rector's Tithe Collection - this system worked against the
        introduction of improvements to husbandry, while at the same time it
        was attended with very disagreeable consequences, both in religious and
        political points of view. It created a division between the Parson and
        his Parishioners as to render the religious instruction of the former of
        little avail.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">In 1808 the
        Blisworth Tithe system was abolished, the Rector being allocated
        land instead, which became his Glebe Farm. Mr. P. Gulliver's land on the
        Towcester Road is still so named, although it no longer belongs to the
        Church.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">Together with the
        Tithe System, so went another ancient village custom whereby our Parsons
        had been obliged to keep and provide for the village use a Bull and a
        Boar! This service he no longer had to give.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">In the midst of
        all this change the canal was also completed.&nbsp; The tunnel had been opened
        in 1805.&nbsp; I like to think that our Rector was amongst the
        thousands who flocked to &quot;view the stupendous works, the
        Band played and there was great rejoicing&quot;.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">It was reported
        that the canal had brought a respectable trade to Blisworth where there
        were erected an extensive wharfage and warehouses for goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        If the trade was respectable, many of the 'navvies' evidently
        were not so.&nbsp; Most probably at the invitation of the Rector, the Magistrates
        of the Division of Towcester and Northampton were duly called upon to
        settle the disputes between masters and labourers employed at Blisworth
        (1793-1805). &quot;And more especially in enforcing the more decent
        observances of the Sabbath.&quot;&nbsp; The Magistrates commenced to meet at
        the &quot;Grafton Arms&quot; on the 19th November 1800, with further
        meetings as circumstances required.<o:p>&nbsp; Many navvies and
        their families must have lived rough, for the village cottage
        accommodation was overcrowded.&nbsp; It was in 1804 that the Rev. John Ambrose
        made this entry in the Baptisms:-<o:p>&nbsp; &quot;Aaron, son
        of Abner &amp; Sarah Smith was born (in the open field) Jan. 25 and
        baptised Jan. 29 1804&quot;<o:p></o:p>.</font></p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080"><a name="90"></a>(90)&nbsp; The Church
        throughout the past centuries has been the willing mouthpiece of many
        diverse civil appeals.&nbsp; Through the Pulpit, together with the Office of
        the Vestry Meeting, and the Church Wardens, monies were regularly
        collected and redistributed to the poor, the workless and also to road and bridge
        improvements, etc. One of the most frequent appeals, came from villages
        or towns which had suffered from a major fire. Our past Rectors were
        often called upon to read such appeals from the pulpit.&nbsp; From the 17th
        Century Church Warden's Accounts, we see that the sum of 3/7d. was
        collected and sent to Bridgenorth following the great fire there: the
        sum of 3/7d was sent to Oxford on another occasion. Great Draiton
        received 8/4d, while the collections for fire damage at Condover in
        Salop was 3/9d.&nbsp; Pontefract Castle received the sum of 3/8½d, etc.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">In 1797 our new
        Rector, the Rev. John Ambrose, probably stood at his Old Rectory wall
        and surveyed the totally thatched village of Blisworth, together with
        numerous farmsteads all packed tightly together.&nbsp; (As yet there were none of the present outlying farms.)&nbsp; Little
        did he think that soon it would be his turn to send out a 'Fire Brief ' instead of receiving one.&nbsp;
        On the morning of <a href="../Greatfire.htm"> May 28th, 1798</a>, around 11am a servant girl incautiously threw out some hot ashes into the
        farmyard
        situated in High Street, which falling upon some straw set fire to the
        same. Almost instantly the fire caught the thatch of the surrounding
        buildings. The fire began at Mr. Hedge's farm, whose whole house together
        with eleven others was in a short time consumed, besides stacks of corn

        Ambrose, our 46th recorded Rector, 1797-1839, together with his 730
        parishioners (1801 census) certainly saw more changes in the village
        than any of his predecessors. In his first year there were sixteen
        burials and thirteen baptisms; there were only two burials in 1798,
        these being a GIBBS and a WHITLOCK, but there were sixteen baptisms. In 1799
        there were ten burials and fifteen baptisms. Many of the new babies
        belonged to parents who had come to Blisworth to seek work on the new
        canal. At the close of the Rev. Ambrose's term at Blisworth the resident
        population had risen to 882, and it is interesting to note that around
        two thirds of the brides at that period were described as &quot;lacemakers.&quot;<o:p>

        around 1500. As a trustee the Rector would have had much to do in
        arranging the building of the new school (which building is now the 'Old
        School'). A portion of the school ground was sold to Mr. William Westley,
        the Miller, who built his new tall stone house adjoining the school, and

        canal and railway proprietors. Then there would be the Church Vestry
        Meetings, and the Court Leets which were held at the Royal Oak. These
        meetings were the ancient seats of Government between villagers and
        their landlord, the Duke of Grafton, at which rents and land
        allocations were annually administered, etc.<o:p>

        system.
        This formation of the fields, together with the hedge planting, took
        place between the years 1808 to 1815.<o:p>&nbsp; The Rev. John
        Ambrose also faced the growing competition of the Baptists. In 1807
        their Sunday School attendance was approximately sixty pupils, and
        later, in 1825, they bought a plot of land for £10 on which they built
        their first Chapel (previously meetings had been held in a barn.)<o:p>

        George III. The morning was ushered in by the ringing of the Church Bells
        and the flag was displayed on the Tower. A fat sheep was roasted whole,
        and a great number of women were provided with cake and tea in the
        street. By 5pm the sheep was distributed among the poor people, with
        bread and butter in equal portions to each family. A Supper was
        afterwards provided at the &quot;Grafton Arms&quot; where several of
        the respectable inhabitants assembled and harmony and convivial mirth
        crowned the festivities of the day.<o:p>&nbsp; In 1820, January
        29th, George III died - and the Rector would have pencilled the name of
        George IV in his Prayer Book as a reminder of the change in Kingship in
        his prayers for the Royal Family.<o:p>

        greatest parish upheaval which our Rector was to witness was the
        construction of the <a href="../Rails.htm"> London to Birmingham Railway</a>. When in 1832 an Act
        was passed, little did the people of Blisworth realise that soon many
        hundreds of rough 'navigators' would be around the village digging out
        the great Blisworth Cutting (now called Roade Cutting) together with the
        great embankment across the lower end of the Parish. Many parsons and
        land owners protested against the coming of the new railway.<o:p>&nbsp; The &quot;navvies&quot;
        brought trouble to the village in many ways, but the Rev. John Ambrose
        (some time absent, see later) lived to see the new wonder of the day passing through the Parish i.e.
        the Steam Railway Engine.&nbsp; I wonder what he thought about it? My guess is that he
        simply hated it, much preferring his pony. Some 3000 barrels of
        gunpowder were exploded during the construction of 'Blisworth'
        cutting.&nbsp; I wonder if the Rector protested against the vibrations damaging the
        Church Tower? His Parish Church though and Rectory had remained
        unchanged, the Church with its box pews etc. and his brown stone tudor
        rectory adjoining.<o:p>

        Northampton Mercury of September 28th, 1839, the following brief
        announcement appeared:&nbsp; &quot;On
        the 20th last the Lord Bishop of Peterborough instituted the Rev.
        George Barry to the Rectory of Blisworth vacant by the death of the Rev.
        J. Ambrose, on the presentation of the Trustees of the Will of John
        Barry Esq.&quot;&nbsp; Recorded on our Parish Church List of Rectors and other
        official documents the new Rector's name is given as WILLIAM (was the
        name George a reporter's error?) William Barry M.A. was a product of
        Trinity College Cambridge having obtained his BA in 1825 and his MA
        in 1828. By the will of his Father he also was the Patron of the Living.<o:p>&nbsp;
        It is generally
        understood that the Barry family were of Whitby or Hull stock; many
        Church monuments in that north-eastern area
        carry the name of Barry, and they were certainly connected with the sea
        either as shipbuilders or ship owners.<o:p>

        sorry that the Rev. Barry did not leave us a record of his method of
        transport to Blisworth in 1839.&nbsp;
        He had three alternatives: the
        ancient road system of horse and coach on roads much improved since the
        previous century, the successful canal transport a main link of
        which actually skirted the new Rector's paddock and there was the
        &quot;new fangled&quot; steam railway, which had a station at Blisworth,
        and was in direct communication with London and the North. I often wish
        too that our past Rectors had contributed to a continuous journal of
        their own attitudes, together with the villager's views on all these
        changes within the Parish.<o:p>

        throne in 1837 - the two major bridges in our Parish, the stone
        arch and the iron bridge over the canal, were near to completion. The
        new Rector and Villagers would have celebrated the young Queen's
        marriage in 1840, but I wonder if the Rev. Wm. Barry agreed with the
        Archbishop of Canterbury who maintained that &quot;unpopular&quot;
        Albert could not be included in the customary prayers for the Royal
        Family.<o:p>

        Rectory to which the new Rector came in 1839 was
        undoubtedly a little dilapidated and draughty - it could well have been
        thatched in keeping with the other buildings of that period. It was
        probably built around 1610 and it stood alongside the Churchyard wall.
        The Rector would have seen and heard the passage of the horse drawn
        coaches and other vehicles as they negotiated the tedious Towcester Road
        Hill - then called West Bridge Hill. He would have seen the coaches
        pulling into the yard of the relatively new &quot;Duke of Grafton's
        Arms&quot; Coaching Inn, while just over the road nearer to the Rectory
        stood the &quot;Half Moon Inn&quot;.<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">The Turnpike from
        Towcester to Northampton had been established as such in 1794 and the
        Rector would have noticed the ever increasing traffic which was now
        running to the new Blisworth Station. This station was the
        nearest and most convenient one to the town of Northampton.&nbsp; Mails, even
        at that early date, were brought out from Northampton and District to
        Blisworth Station for despatch by train. Those new trains, in 1840, took
        approximately three hours to travel from Blisworth to London, while the
        total journey from London to Birmingham took 5½ hours. Maps
        of the first quarter of the 19th century show the <a href="../Highsttwo.htm"> Toll Gate</a> in line with
        the Church. In 1840 the Turnpike Trustees met at the &quot;Duke of
        Grafton's Arms&quot; to view and negotiate with the new Rector for
        ground in the vicinity of the Toll Gate and the Canal Bridge in an
        effort to speed up and improve the difficult road approach to the
        village from Towcester. The Rector agreed to exchange land lying near to
        the Turnpike Gate for a lesser quantity on the side nearest to the Canal
        Bridge.&nbsp; Mr. Barry also agreed to build (or rebuild) his boundary wall on
        a new line as staked out.&nbsp; This
        deal could well explain the present piece of land on the old &quot;Sun
        Moon and Stars&quot; side which still belongs to the
        Rectory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It certainly
        appears that with all this sudden change around his old Rectory within
        his first three years of coming to Blisworth prompted the Rector to
        build the new Elizabethan style Rectory a little further to the
        southwest of the old
        building. Although the Parish had a first class Stone Works and Quarry
        on the Stoke Road established in 1821, he chose to procure his stone
        from a quarry opened up on the Towcester
        Road at the Rectory Farm. (surely not)&nbsp;
        So it was that in 1842 the fine new Rectory
        was built and the former Tudor Rectory was demolished.<o:p>&nbsp; <i>There
        is no evidence that that <u>slate-ish</u> limestone quarry in Rectory
        Farm could have provided the good blocks of stone for the 1841 Rectory
        building.&nbsp; The new line for rectory land would take in a new
        coach-house which protruded further <a href="../Highsttwo.htm">into the
        High Street</a> than the old coach-house and this looks as though the
        main road was been planned to take the <a href="../Bypass&#32;History.htm">by-passing
        route</a>.&nbsp; The old High Street would then join the main road at a
        T-junction.&nbsp; Land in all four quadrants around the bridge was
        rendered glebe land in 1808 and as such seemed to encircle the aforesaid
        &quot;Sun, Moon and Stars&quot; known then as the Half Moon Inn.</i></o:p></o:p>

        to the Induction of our 47th recorded Rector, the Rev. Wm.

        previous Rector, the Rev. John Ambrose, had been buried on June 6th,
        1839 at the age of 71 years, and the new Rector
        commenced duties on September 28th, 1839.&nbsp; A Curate, the
        Rev. E.R. Butcher, officiated during the three months break. During the
        next 45 years the Rev. Wm. Barry was supported by a host of Curates,

        1839 the Rev. Wm. Barry conducted his first marriage at
        Blisworth, between George Watson, a Miller from Norton, and Sarah
        Sheppard, whose father was a village farmer; their ages were not
        recorded other than the customary word &quot;FULLAGE&quot;. The Rector's
        fifth marriage ceremony was in November 1839 between Benjamin Young, a
        Baker from Moulton, and Elizabeth Gudgeon, whose father was a village
        farmer. We still have the name YOUNG in our midst, but the name GUDGEON
        died out early this century.<o:p>&nbsp; There were
        seventeen marriages during the year 1839 - ten Brides were described as
        lacemakers, which was a thriving village industry; one was a dressmaker and one was a Gentlewoman. Of the husbands there were
        labourers, stonemasons, farm servants, a contractor miller, engineer,
        victualler, blacksmith, hatter, carpenter, boatman, and a new named
        occupation caused by the railway - A PLATELAYER.<o:p>&nbsp; His first Baptism
        was on October 16th, 1839 (held in private) the baby being John the son
        of Richard Goodridge who was named as a blacksmith. During the following
        twelve months he conducted thirty-six Baptisms - many of those children
        being the ancestors of our present village families.<o:p>&nbsp; The population
        for 1841 was 442 Males and 440 females - total 882, an increase of 186
        since a previous count in 1821.<o:p>&nbsp; Of the Rector's

        Church building which the Rev. Wm. Barry accepted in 1839? I am sure that he found it very much in need of repair. The shallow lead
        covered roof probably leaked, resulting in the rotting of the ancient
        oak timbers. Windows of plain glass would have been in need of
        restoration. Inside there would have been the musicians' gallery at the
        West End, squared box pews, presumably a double decker pulpit, no organ,
        candles for illumination. There is evidence too that much of the
        stonework was painted.<o:p>

        although the new Railway had a local station, which served Northampton,
        and was briefly called &quot;Northampton and Blisworth Station&quot;,
        many important local people, including the Turnpike Trustees, considered
        the Station inconvenient and totally inadequate, perched as it was on
        the high embankment next to the Stone Arch. Local meetings were held
        from 1840 pressing for a &quot;first class&quot; station on level ground, for the
        better accommodation of vehicles and passengers. A bypass for the
        village was also mapped at this period!&nbsp; It was not until 1845 that the
        new Station was opened serving the new branch line from Blisworth, via
        Northampton, to Peterborough. Thus our Rectors from then on could go to
        the Bishop and the Cathedral by steam train instead of by a jolty horse

        (our 47th recorded Rector) 1839-1884, having built for himself and his
        family the fine new Rectory in 1841-2, must have very soon afterwards
        decided to tackle the restoration of the Church. As stated previously,
        the Church, although then much in need of repair, must have been very
        beautiful in its overall rusticity, for little work had been done on the
        fabric since the 17th Century.<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">The mid 19th
        Century proved (often regretted now) to be an over zealous period of
        Church restoration. Squires and Parsons alike destroyed many fine early
        features in their efforts to produce a &quot;clean sweep&quot;
        structure. <a href="../Church-Images2.htm"> Plans were drawn up</a> in May 1855 and soon the great flat lead
        covered roof, together with the medieval timbers, was removed from
        chancel and nave. The north aisle and porch were similarly treated.<o:p>&nbsp;
        Inside, the singing gallery was removed and the tower arch was thrown open. The
        west-end doorway was restored with the present window, the seats were
        remodelled, and the dark paint was removed from the stone pillars and
        arches. The total wall area was treated with a coat of stucco.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The
        Church took on a completely new look, for the chosen plan was one of a
        steep pitched roof covered with Westmorland slates. During the
        restoration, the Church was closed for worship and Services were
        continued in a barn which stood on the opposite side of the
        High Street. The Christmas early Communion of 1855 in the barn was
        described as most beautiful and moving.&nbsp; It is written that the
        stars could be seen peeping through the cracks in the great doors.<o:p>

        soon came, for on Thursday, January 17th 1856, in the afternoon, the
        Church was re-opened. The cost of the restoration was £868.17. 9d.&nbsp;
        The
        Service was well publicized, with the chief attraction being the sermon,
        which was preached by the Rev. W. Wales, M.A., Chancellor of the
        Diocese. This announcement was followed in very small print stating that
        the &quot;Service would begin at 2.30 p.m. after which a collection will
        be taken in aid of the Restoration Fund which is very considerably
        deficient.&quot;&nbsp; This collection produced £44.4.7d.&nbsp; Prayers were said
        by the Rector, Rev. W. Barry, and the lessons were read by the Rev.
        Wm. Clay, Curate. The two proud wardens officiating at this memorable
        service were William Worster and C.E. Roper. Mr. Worster was the
        landlord of the &quot;Grafton Arms&quot; and Mr. Roper was a Farmer and

        attached. The long row of 'Railway Cottages' and the Westley tenement block in

        remember that until comparatively recent times, the officers of the

        Wardens who collected and administered the parish monies which went for
        the assistance of the poor and needy. Thus from our Church Records we
        find that the Wardens paid 3/- for 6lb of mutton for &quot;John Fretter
        when in distress&quot;, l/8d was paid for a person to sit up with a
        sick parishioner, the money being spent on a candle, some bread, sugar,
        tea and butter, for refreshment.&nbsp; Lettuce Gibbons was given l/6d for a
        pair of stockings, 1/-&nbsp; for
        shoes, and 2/- for stays. In fact, the Church and the village people

        Barry, our 47th recorded Rector 1839-1884 continues.<o:p>&nbsp; During the
        building of the new Rectory in 1842, the family living next door must
        have been keenly interested. At Blisworth House lived Mr. George Stone
        together with his wife, four daughters <i> and a son, which GF admits he
        originally overlooked.</i>&nbsp; 'Squire' Stone, as he was affectionately named, was himself
        the son of the Rev. George Stone, Rector of Hopton in Suffolk. Coming to
        Blisworth Rouse in 1826, Mr. Stone lived to be one of the patriarchs of
        the time, and was a great supporter of the Church.&nbsp; Of his four daughters, three married and went away; Louisa, the
        youngest, remained at Blisworth to look after her Father as long as he

        Magistrate of this County, 46 years a resident of this Parish. Born Jan.
        1789, died Jan.1872. Throughout the long period of his connection with
        the Parish and the neighbourhood there was not a breath of disparagement
        connected with his name. Louisa was devoted to the village and the
        Church; it is recorded that she inspired deep affection and influence
        with her family and all those with whom she came in contact. Before compulsory education
        (introduced in1870) she gave much of her time in
        teaching the village children to read, conducting the popular
        &quot;penny readings&quot; which were a form of evening schooling. She
        also taught the village boys to play cricket, for Blisworth during much
        of the last century produced a continuous line of first class cricket
        teams - in fact, one of the greatest last century Umpires at Lords
        received his early cricket 'education' at Blisworth,<o:p>

        also a keen follower to the hounds, living up to the old axiom
        &quot;Keep your temper and stick to the line.&quot; She gave much of her
        time to the London Soho Mission which was connected with an Anglican
        Sisterhood of St. Margaret at East Grinstead. In 1871 these Sisters were
        deeply involved in a Shoreditch out­break of Smallpox, the accounts of
        which read even worse than the present Cholera conditions in
        India.&nbsp; In
        1872 Squire Stone died.&nbsp; Louisa then moved to St. Margarets at East
        Grinstead; in the following year she was invited to go&nbsp;to Boston in America to establish a branch of the Sisterhood
        there, and there she remained until her death in 1909 at the age of 85
        after 36 years as Mother Superior.<o:p>&nbsp; It is recorded
        that in her old age, as she stood at the door in Boston looking up at
        the North Star, she exclaimed &quot;to think that is the same star which
        we used to gaze at from the porch door at dear Blisworth.&quot;&nbsp; In a
        tribute to her, published in &quot;the Living Church&quot; Milwaukie,
        U.S.A., she is described as &quot;Generous and open-minded, to others
        thoughtful and considerate....she was selfless rather than unselfish.
        Absolute forgiveness was another mark of that loving heart; she forgave
        so completely that she entirely forgot, and trusted again where few
        could follow her in it.<o:p></o:p>&quot;&nbsp;<i> The American Stone

        built in 1874.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        school, however, was much under the control of the Church, and amongst
        the daily instruction was the Catechism taken from the Book of Common
        Prayer.&nbsp; Many Baptists objected to this doctrinal teaching, some parents
        even refusing to pay the rate which helped to support the school. Quite
        a number of Baptist children were taken away from the village school and
        sent to the New National School at Roade. Tradesmen's sons in general
        continued to go to the Courteenhall Grammar School until 1898, when on

        Rev. H. T. Barry, Rector 1884 - 1904 continued:&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Saxon times
        the government of Village affairs was mainly conducted by the Annual
        Vestry, which was an intimate union of Church and State. The elected
        members, together with the Incumbent, constituted a kind of parochial
        government, who concurred with the Rector in appointing Churchwardens;
        who elected other parish officers, as overseers of the poor and of
        highways for which they had to supply the funds. Their meetings were
        originally held in the Church Vestry - hence the assembly taking their
        name from the place of meeting. It was the right of the Incumbent to
        take the Chair; in his absence those present had to elect a Chairman. It
        would appear that the first of the Barry Rectors, William Barry
        1839-1884, had not exercised his rights by taking the Chair during the
        latter years of his incumbency; his son, Henry Thomas, however, soon
        interested himself in the Vestry, for at the March Vestry of 1885 he
        duly took the Chair. During the years prior, Chairman's names were C.E.
        Roper (Farmer of Hill Farm) Capt. T.C. Maunsell (Blisworth House), Jos.
        Westley (Miller).<o:p>

        collection of taxes etc.); Mr. J. J. Carter (Home Farm) was elected the
        Waywarden, whose duty was to watch over the condition of roads in the
        Parish - but this office was on the decline - and Messrs. U. J. Birch

        vanishing. A general readjustment of the relations of the Church and
        State was evident, and it is likely that at this time two
        &quot;vestries&quot; were already being held, one for the secular and
        the other for the ecclesiastical business of the parish. The
        &quot;Vestries&quot; during the last Century were generally held in the
        Parish Church and the members were &quot;called&quot; by the chiming of

        the Vestry of 1880 resolved unanimously that they were not satisfied

        whereupon the Rector invited all present to adjourn to the Rectory where
        the 'drains' could be more freely discussed. At subsequent meetings the
        improved drainage of the village was put into operation at the total
        cost of £234. 4. 2d. A special rate of l/6d in the £ on buildings

        Club&quot;.&nbsp; This club was sponsored by the village landlord, the Duke of
        Grafton, together with the parish tenant farmers. Sparrows were
        considered a great menace to the corn crops, and the villagers were
        invited to catch and kill as many as possible, the Vestry fixing the
        price per head. The Sexton during the Rev. H.T. Barry's time was William
        Whitlock (1872-1905 Sexton) and it was part of his duty to receive the
        dead sparrows and pay out the cash. A Vestry of 1889 resolved 6d per
        dozen for adult birds caught from Michaelmas to Lady Day, and 3d per

        of record too that many villagers caught and made sparrows into a
        delectable pie - using only their breasts in quantity, together with
        layers of home cured bacon. Sparrows were usually &quot;netted&quot; at
        night time - after the birds had gone to a communal roost in the ivy, or
        creepers, on the buildings, (a previous

        Mr. Sturgess weighed people on his flour weighing machine, and

        large, and consisted mainly of children.&nbsp; The Western end of the nave
        was apparently given over to the school children, but others sat in twos
        or threes all over the Church. They behaved most properly all the time,
        and though during the reading of the Second Lesson an animated 'confab'
        was carried on behind me in a very audible whisper, the culprits, I saw
        on turning round, were well up in the teens.&quot;</o:p>

        &quot;The
        Service, as in most country Churches was full measure of Matins, Litany,
        and ante-Communion, but the most inveterate grumbler could not complain
        of its length, for the Rector (The Rev. H.T. Barry) rattled through
        Psalms, Lessons and Prayers, at a pace that could not be beaten by an
        auctioneer over the conditions of sale, or of a clerk of arraigns over
        the proclamation against vice and immorality - do not
        mistake me&quot; wrote Joshua, &quot;I don't mean to imply that
        there was any irreverent hurry or indecent haste.&nbsp; He had not to pull up now and again for sheer lack of breath, as
        I half-expected at first, for he is evidently subject to bronchial

          included a twenty minute sermon, a portion of the Psalms, which were
          read and not sung, and the lessons were a moderate length, but making all
          allowance I am sure, Joshua wrote: &quot;Mr. Barry could give any of
          his brother clergymen ten minutes start over Morning Service and then
          COME IN AN EASY WINNER.&quot; Joshua goes on to mention the Rector's
          heavy beard, of which he says &quot;was fatal to elocution&quot;, and
          he doubted whether a stranger to the Anglican Service would have
          understood him.&nbsp; &quot;Curiously
          enough&quot; continues Joshua, &quot;he slows down considerably in the
          pulpit, and as his sermon was
          closely read from manuscript, from the look of the leaves as he turned
          them over, I imagine that that discourse had done duty on at least one
          occasion before.&quot;&nbsp; Joshua wondered that perhaps he had difficulty in reading
          his own hand writing.&nbsp; &quot;The
          sermon, which was prefaced by neither collect nor invocation, was
          based on &quot;Your Father Abraham rejoiced to see My Day&quot;
          from the Gospel of the day, and was a discourse of average merit,

        </span>The Communion Table is, as I have said, devoid of ornament, and
        the Choir - of mail voices only, who have a decided tendency to get flat
        periodically - is not surpliced, and the Rector (the Rev. H.T. Barry)
        wears no cassock,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>but a
        flowing surplice, which yet does not reach his heels. But the Eastward
        position is observed in the Creed, and though the Glorias are unmarked
        in any Way, I noticed that several people did reverence at each recurrence,
        of the Holy Name, as when in the reading of the Gospel as in the hymns,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        fault finding at Blisworth Church, and though I can't say that I regard
        the express speed with which the service is run through as one that is
        worth general adoption, it need not interfere with ones

        christened William Henry, but was destined to be called
        &quot;Harry&quot; from an early age and throughout his lifetime. His
        first name &quot;William&quot; was that of his Grandfather (our Rector
        from 1339-1894), his second name &quot;Henry&quot; was taken from his
        Father (our Rector 1884-1904).&nbsp; It

        Barry's juvenile days were passed at Winchester College. Later, when at

        BA in 1898, but his ordination did not take place until three years
        later. His MA followed in 1902 when he was made Priest by Bishop
        Mitchinson in the absence of Bishop Glyn, who was suffering from the
        effects of a serious riding accident.<o:p>&nbsp; There is no doubt
        at all that the Rev. Harry Barry was a keen horseman and follower of the
        hounds, and I am prompted to think that the &quot;Quorn&quot;, as well
        as the Church, attracted him to Melton Mowbrey, where for two years he
        spent a busy time ministering to the needs of 8,000 parishioners.&nbsp; He worked hard with all the enthusiasm of his fervent nature
        which won him golden opinions. Regretfully, in 1903, he left the
        bustling atmosphere of Melton Mowbrey and returned to the tranquility of
        the family parish at Blisworth, complete with its &quot;pretty little

        place in the affections of the people.&nbsp; He followed in the traditions of his family as a Conservative in

        questions of the day.<o:p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev.
        Harry Barry, like his Father had been, soon became a notable hunting

        resident Squires, and a &quot;nice sprinkling of Parsons,&quot; for whom
        all seemingly had the greatest regard, and of whom it was thought that
        one of their greatest duties on earth was to countenance and encourage
        good fellowship via the hunting field !! Of our Rector it was
        reported that &quot;he had a rider's cheery disposition, and infectious
        geniality, fully enjoying a smart run with the Grafton on a cold and
        frosty morning.&quot;&nbsp; It

        1905, the new Rector held his first Vestry. New Wardens and Officers
        were duly appointed.&nbsp; There
        was one vacancy for an ancient and important post, for William &quot;Clocky&quot;
        Whitlock, the Sexton and Parish Clerk, had recently died after serving his
        Church for 34 years.<o:p>&nbsp; The Rector
        announced that the vacancy of Sexton would be filled by the appointment
        of&nbsp; MR.WILLIAM AYRES, who was certainly no stranger to our Church. His
        Father had been a choir member for seventy years, which would go back to
        the time when the choir and musicians would occupy the minstrels'
        gallery which was then at the rear of the Church. On his retirement he
        was presented with a walking stick and address.<o:p>

        train to Blisworth for the surrounding area.&nbsp; The trains did not stop to discharge the mail bags, but both
        delivery and collection was done via a special apparatus beside the

        Ethel, became a Sunday School Teacher and conducted her classes
        regularly for 40 years; she also played the organ for children's
        Services.&nbsp; The other son,

        the coronation of her eldest son Edward VII.<o:p>&nbsp; Both of these two
        national occasions were duly marked by the village people, one of
        mourning, and the latter by village celebration of harmony and convivial
        mirth; the Church marking the occasion by a special Service.<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">The Rector spent
        ten halcyon Edwardian years at Blisworth.&nbsp; (King Edward died in 1910, the Rector vacated the living at
        Blisworth in 1914.) The Duke of Grafton was still the Landlord of most
        of the village; cottage rents were approximately £2 per annum; the
        villagers, some rich but mostly not so rich, divided their affections and
        loyalties between the Church and the Chapel, and attendances were good.<o:p>&nbsp;
        The children of
        the village went to one or the other of the Stoke Road Schools (one
        &quot;infant&quot; and the other the &quot;senior&quot;).&nbsp; The Rector was a chief trustee of the School, which was still
        governed by the ancient Wake Endowment trust.&nbsp; Compulsory Education was not yet fifty years of age, but already
        there were signs of discontent over the Church administration and the
        overcrowding.<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">I should
        imagine that the Edwardian age suited our Rector.&nbsp; We are told that at times he possessed six hunters, and one
        carriage horse; this meant the full employment of a stud groom and two
        ordinary grooms: the Rectory gardens were well maintained by a gardener
        and a gardener's boy, who would also help in the house.&nbsp; The household was similarly endowed with a staff to administer to
        the needs of the Rector and his family.<o:p>&nbsp; Naturally, the Rector was a
        great supporter of the Grafton Hunt.&nbsp; His neighbour - the aging Captain
        Elmburst, was a very notable horseman.&nbsp; The two men would often ride out
        together, and it was customary whenever possible for the boys of the
        village to open the field and bridle gates for the horse riders, for
        which service they received a small tip. One village lad on receiving
        three pence from the Rector, remarked &quot;Thank you, Sirl You're a
        gentleman.&quot; To which the Rev. &quot;Harry&quot; replied,
        &quot;Well, boy, in that case here is another three pence.&quot;<o:p>

        of the Rector was to regularly visit the day school in Stoke Road and to
        give religious instruction, which included the Catechism.&nbsp; From the last Century the village Baptist leaders had objected to
        the teaching of the Catechism to Baptist children, together with the
        influence of the Church over the school.&nbsp; Some Baptists in fact took their children away from the Blisworth
        School and sent them to the National School at Roade which was
        completely non-denominational.&nbsp; By
        1906 their protests, coupled with general dissatisfaction of the
        school and the over­crowding, brought about the condemnation of the
        Ancient Wake Endowed School which had served the Village and its
        scholars for 400 years.&nbsp; The
        School, however, did not close down until 1913 on May 30th.<o:p>

        were the GUDGEONS, WORSTERS, CARTERS, ROPERS and MONTGOMERYS.&nbsp; Another very useful member of the Congregation was JOHN GREEN
        the cobbler of Stoke Road, who, especially at Christmas, decorated the

        paid out in voucher form worth 5/5d, which could be cashed at MRS.

        Thriftiness amongst the cottagers was considered a great

        Gleanings&quot;.<o:p>&nbsp; Had the family not come from Whitby in
        1839 (when the first
        of the three Barrys became our Rector) we might never have had the new
        Rectory in 1841, nor the Church restored so heavily in the mid-last
        century. But change is inevitable, though sometimes lamented.&nbsp; I think I
        would have preferred the old Church with its flat lead covered roof and
        its ancient twisted oak timbers, the box pews and the three-decker
        pulpit.

        few queries relating to his family.&nbsp; Mr. David Barry wrote that he left
        Blisworth in the month before World War I was declared, in 1914, at the
        age of seven years.&nbsp; He therefore does not have any great recollection of
        the village.&nbsp; Of his sister I knew even less, although local legend
        stated that Miss Barry (the Rev. Harry's daughter) had
        married an artist named John.&nbsp; This
        story was also related to me recently by Mrs. W. Harris.&nbsp; So I asked Mr. David Barry if his sister had in fact married
        Augustus John, the great painter. Mr. Barry in his letter said 'No' to
        my question, but &quot;she did marry a son of Augustus John.&quot;&nbsp;
        (note: Augustus John's first wife was Ida Nettleship, and

        1839 were ship builders at Whitby, and that William, who was later to
        became our first Barry Rector was born near Whitby. The reason given
        for the termination of the Barry family shipbuilding enterprise, was
        when the wooden ships of the day became too large to be launched in the
        harbour at Whitby.<o:p>

        Mr. David Barry subscribed an item of interest - he remarks that his
        Grandfather (I think he must mean his Great Grandfather) contracted
        typhoid through carrying a housewife upstairs and putting her to bed,
        after he had found her very ill in her chair when he called upon her at
        Blisworth Arm.&nbsp; However, this all ties up with another local legend that
        a boat woman had brought the wretched disease to Blisworth.
        On looking through the Register of Burials I found two entries relating
        to typhus.&nbsp; Entry No. 516,
        February 8th, 1851, records that Helen Broadway of Blisworth Hotel died
        at the age of 26 years of typhus fever, and a following entry Mo. 518,
        March 10th, 1851, tells of the death of William Carter aged 16 years 3
        months, who also died of typhus: this I consider all relates to a
        village outbreak of typhus, to which Mr. David Barry refers, and which
        affected his Great Grandfather, but I will later confirm this.<o:p>

        concludes by telling of his father's departure from Bliswarth in 1914,

        moved to Wittering in the Soke of Peterborough, where he remained until
        1935.&nbsp; After the death of
        his wife he returned and lived in a room at Fotheringay until his death
        in 1946, thus bringing to a close the three successive generations of
        the family Barry, who, from father to son, had been our Rectors from

        For this month's notes I have taken a look at the Vestry Meetings held during the
        incumbency of the first of the Barry Rectors, the Rev. Wm. Barry, M.A.,
        1839-1884.&nbsp; Church expenses
        were very small in relation to today, and collections were only taken
        occasionally - the greatest expenditure was when in 1856 the Church
        was completely restored and re-roofed. The Rector paid his 'Moity', or
        1/I0th of the total cost (£104.&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; 10½d) out of his own money.<o:p>

        were popular and well supported.&nbsp; A
        typical one held in 1842 saw 21 parishioners confirmed; afterwards they
        enjoyed a hot dinner and ales at the cost to the Church of l/9d per
        head. The Rector, his Warden Mr. Gibbs, and the Sexton Jos. Davis, also
        partook of the feast, but they must have had a 3d extra each, for their
        bill came to 2/- per head which likewise was paid by the Church.<o:p>

        &quot;To Whitlock, horse and van, to Towcester, 5/-, toll fees
        and ostler, l/6d.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
        would have been the toll gate situated near to the present Tiffield
        turn, and the Whitlock could have been the young &quot;Clocky&quot;
        Whitlock, the Uncle of our late Sexton William liJhitlock.&nbsp; In August of the same year the Rev. Puckle (Curate) went to a
        confirmation at Northampton, and again Whitlock, horse and van were
        employed.&nbsp; 5/6d was charged
        by Whitlock for the day, and the Rev. Puckle's additional expenses
        amounted to 19/-.<o:p>

        communions.&nbsp; In 1871 the
        number had risen to thirteen services for the year.&nbsp; A pint of wine was allocated for each communion, which in 1840
        was l/3d per pint, gradually increasing to 2/6d per pint by 1870.&nbsp; The Sexton/Clerk of 1842 was Joseph Davis (a name which still has
        connections with some of our older village families). He received around
        £7.16.3d. per annum.&nbsp; In
        1842 it was resolved at the Vestry Meeting &quot;that in future no

        Gleanings continued&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our Church
        heating systems prior to 1800 we seem to know little.&nbsp; It is fairly certain that Blisworth Church would have seen
        charcoal braziers in use, for wood and charcoal were readily available
        in Midland Northants.&nbsp; Records from the past from other Churches also state that
        straw was laid down on the pew floors for the winter comfort of the

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">Coal first came
        to Blisworth in quantity by the canal.&nbsp; From around 1797 hundreds of tons of coal were unloaded on to the
        wharf next to the Mill Bridge at 10d per cwt.&nbsp; From our own records it does not appear that our Church rushed
        straight in to the &quot;coal rush&quot; for heating.&nbsp; It is not until 1840 that the records mention coal.&nbsp;
        By the first amounts of coal purchased it can be presumed that
        there was just one small free standing stove in Church, for the account
        of 1840 states that only 7/1½d worth of coal was used.&nbsp; Regular purchases of coal follow from then on, rising up to the
        outrageous figure of 1/- per cwt. by 1859 when 12 cwt. was bought.&nbsp;
        New heating methods could have been installed by 1872, for John
        Davis wan paid regularly for &quot;lighting and stoking fires and for
        cleaning flues&quot;.&nbsp; For such services he was paid occasionally the sum
        of 6/-.&nbsp; By 1873 the coal

        presumably something was done. The old heating stores of Captain
        Maunsell's day still exist under the gratings in the aisles.&nbsp; This system was hot air only (plus bad fumes often).&nbsp;
        At a later date an outside boiler house was built and the Church
        became heated by hot water radiators.&nbsp; Now it is oil-fired at the cost of £115.69 annually.<o:p>

        lamps in 1861).&nbsp; In 1867 the
        Church purchased &quot;Lamps and Oil&quot; for £1. 2. 0d.&nbsp; In 1873 a lamp and post was erected at the Church gate at a cost
        of £2.&nbsp; 0.&nbsp; 0d.&nbsp; Evidently an

        they were very temperamental, and many of us remember the hissing
        noises and failures of those lamps, especially when the Sexton had to
        pump them up during a Service! &nbsp;It
        was not until March 1931 that a meeting discussed the 'new' form of
        lighting, and it was proposed by Mr. E. Griffith, seconded by Mr. J.&nbsp;Digby, that &quot;the Parish Church of Blisworth be

        years past the care and attention to Churchyard grass and paths has
        taken a considerable amount of man's time.&nbsp; As labour was so plentiful and cheap the cost of maintenance was
        not so difficult.&nbsp; Gravel
        for the paths was easy to obtain, and there are regular entries of
        gravel purchased.&nbsp; In
        jumping the years, the last large consignment of 18 tons of gravel came
        from Cosgrove to Blisworth by canal boat, transported free of charge by
        the Grand Junction Canal Company.&nbsp; That
        was in 1926.</font></p>

        stones for the Churchyard wall cost 3/- in 1856. A new gate to the
        Churchyard cost £1.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; 0d. in the same year and £20 in
        1968. There was
        also a goodly amount of window repairs, but seldom was the charge for
        glazing more than l/3d.&nbsp; Church
        windows were often cleaned for 2/-. Samuel Goode was paid 3/6d for
        cleaning out all Church gutters and spouts. Bell ropes were sometimes
        bought or repaired from and by Mr. J. Amos (ropemaker) of Stoke Bruerne.<o:p>

        problem in getting workers.&nbsp; An average of 2/6d was paid to the elders of the village for
        a day's work in keeping the paths and grass in order (rising to 3/6d per
        day by 1903.)&nbsp; John Davis
        was paid 3/- for rolling and weeding the cemetery paths.&nbsp; The
        grass-mowings was sold in lots of 1/- value.&nbsp; Faggot wood from
        the trees was also sold.&nbsp; Another
        interesting item of expenditure was when in 1873&nbsp; Mr. W. Sturgess of
        Roads was paid the sum of 2/- for replacing slates on the Church roof,
        and presumably this would involve ladders etc. and cartage from Roadel&nbsp;

        funerals of that period in which the Church took a major part. Last
        month I mentioned the opening of the new cemetery in 1865. Previously,
        and for some 800 years the village people had been buried in the
        churchyard surrounding the Church.&nbsp; The first villager to be interred in the new cemetery was MARY
        CLARKE aged 22 years (Register No. 686).&nbsp; Entries 687 and 689 tell of two
        members of the CHAMBERS family who died of the dreaded smallpox ...
        these two burials took place in the evening at 8.45pm and 9.30pm
        (Earlier in the century smallpox victims were buried at midnight.)&nbsp;
        Entry
        690 records EMMA BIRCH, born and died in a boat on the canal, aged 4 days.
        Entry 692 tells of the burial of WILLIAM TAYLDR the Parish Clerk, who
        died aged 76 years. From 1813 to 1872 approximately 800 persons were
        buried either in the old or the new burial grounds.&nbsp; This figure does not include the burials in the Baptist

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">Around 1869 our
        late Sexton's Father, W. John Whitlock, was a self employed carpenter
        and undertaker. His charge for making a good English elm coffin complete
        with trimmings, was from £1. 1. 0d. to £1. 15. 0d. At that time a coffin
        for a child cost from 8/- to 13/6d, painted white, with lace trimmings,
        and tinsel angels decorating the lid and sides.&nbsp; Breast or name
        plates
        cost 2/6d, lace was 1d per foot, tinsel angels and flowers 7d each.</font></p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">It was only the
        monied people who hired horse-drawn hearses to carry the coffin.&nbsp; The average cottagers' coffin was carried shoulder high by
        4&nbsp; or 6 hired men.&nbsp; Such
        labour was always readily available, for most village men were employed
        locally, their employers giving permission at short notice.&nbsp; Such jobs were welcomed by the bearers (or carriers) for it meant
        a break from the daily toil on the land, the best suit and bowler hat
        would come out of the 'moth balls', and finally there was always food
        and drink provided by the deceased family members.&nbsp; The Church retained a 'Village Pall' which was loaned out.&nbsp; This cloth covering was draped over the coffin, thus also covering the
        bearers. To enable the two leaders to see where they were rising, the
        pall was turned back at the front end. On arriving at the Church the
        bier was used.&nbsp; The present public bier is still stored at the Church for
        anybody to use, and is the property of the Parish Council. Our late
        Sexton, William Thomas Whitlock, was also a village carpenter and
        undertaker.<o:p>

        Our Church Warden
        account books are so full of interest, rela­ting to our village, that I
        am including another extract from the last century.<o:p>&nbsp; One fact stands
        our very clearly, and this was the extreme poverty of the general
        labourer.&nbsp; The Church,
        through the office of the Vestry Meetings, collected by local taxes and
        redistributed the money to the needy.&nbsp; Each parish was quite willing to
        support its own people, but strangers in need were quickly passed on to
        another perish, or if cash was handed out, it was charged to their own
        parish.<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">On looking
        through a series of entries I noticed that Mrs. Catherine Griffin
        (presumably a native of Blisworth) was stranded at<o:p>
        Stony Stratford at a time of expecting a child. The
        authorities
        there, not wishing to have a baby and mother on their hands, dispatched
        the<o:p>
        expectant mother back to Blisworth.&nbsp;
        The Blisworth wardens,
        confronted with an urgent case, forthwith sent a Mrs. Plowman to
        Northampton to purchase the necessary bedding for the poor Mrs. Griffin.&nbsp;
        One flock mattress, two blankets and one pair of sheets cost the
        wardens £2 and Mrs. Plowman received 1/- (5p) for her
        efforts.<o:p>&nbsp; The new baby was
        born the same evening and was duly named Mary.&nbsp; It later appears that the baby's father deserted his family, for
        in July a warden goes to Northampton for a summons against James
        Griffin, The account book records the following:-<o:p>

        the next eight years the new Rector saw the completion of the canal and
        the Blisworth Tunnel. He also met, through marriages, births and deaths,
        many of the new families whose men folk had come to work on the canal
        construction at Blisworth. The Rev. John Ambrose occupied the Old
        Rectory (now demolished) next to the Church. His predecessor, Nathaniel
        Trotter, had died at Blisworth on 15th February, 1797, so there had not

        for the Officiating Rector to sign the Registers whenever the Archdeacon
        inspected them.&nbsp; At the
        March, 1807, Visitation, John Ambrose, Rector, duly signs, underlining
        his name with a delightful flourish of penmanship (this signature was
        not to appear again until the year 1836). In 1810 the Registers are
        again inspected by the Archdeacon, but this time the entries are signed
        by the Curate, Joseph Sturges. There must have been a dispute over this
        signing, for the Curate's name is crossed out and above it is written
        the name &quot;Maria Ambrose&quot;, who we must assume was the Rector's
        wife and who was signing for her husband ... but where was he?<o:p>

        ... no mention is made of either the Rector or his wife. Soon afterwards
        the Rev. J. Sturges departs from Blisworth and his post is taken by
        another Curate, the Rev. Wm.. Butlin.&nbsp; It is now obvious that the Rector has absented himself from the
        village, for at the 1811 assessment of the Rev. Ambrose's rates for £5.
        12. 3d., the cash was not forthcoming ... neither was he.&nbsp; Also, at this same time, a sequestrator is appointed to handle
        the affairs of the Church in the Rector's absence.&nbsp; In searching through the registers, the Rev. Ambrose's signature
        disappears from the years 1807 - 1836, entries being signed mainly by
        the faithful Curate, the Rev. Wm. Butlin.<o:p>

        of the 19th Century, young Lord Althorp was a great sportsman, a Patron
        of Boxing and a gambler. His companions not only included the great
        prize fighters and pugilists of the day, but also his associates
        included the Prince Regent, Lord Byron ... AND Parson Ambrose, Rector of
        Blisworth: a man too well known in sporting circles.<o:p>&nbsp; Because
        of our Rector's connections with such a mixed company, he was soon
        enveloped in debts through his gambling.&nbsp; It was said that he disgraced a profession which he might
        have adorned, for he was clever, and had a remarkably fine delivery. On
        the death of the great actor, Charles Macklin, the Rev. Ambrose was left
        the sum of £50 to preach the Actor's Funeral Sermon. Around the year
        1808, Lord Althorp reports that Parson Ambrose of Blisworth is obliged
        to flee the country from his creditors, after which it was reported that
        he died abroad in misery and want.<o:p>

        Curate received £28 to £40 per annum.&nbsp; If he was a bachelor, he would either reside at the Rectory on
        payment of his board. If a family man he would rent a cottage and, owing
        to his small wage, he often had to augment his income by teaching, or
        even manual work around the village.&nbsp; Curates in general were expected to be of a high standard of
        education, and to be approved
        and licensed by the Bishop. Many, however, were not of such high
        standard and remained unlicensed, but they appeared to find it easy to

        maximum wage, but no mention was made of a minimum wage. By an Act of
        George III (1796) the maximum stipend for a Curate was £75 per annum,
        but there are records of the minimum paid as law as £20. By this same

        debts, had no cash for his Curate's wages.&nbsp; Hence the Curate was forced to apply to the 3ishop of
        Peterborough for relief money.&nbsp; In
        1805 he received £52.10.0d. A year later ho obtained £40.&nbsp; In 1807/8 he got the sums of £35 and £30 respectively, but was
        cut down to £25 in 1809. The next year he was refused assistance. This

        also adopted a Belgian family of Refugees named van der BERGH who ware
        housed in a bungalow in the Station Road. This family was supported by
        regular contributions.&nbsp; As

        as yet a bachelor, was looked after by a housekeeper and a sister,
        Miss Colley. He also employed a full time gardener and a
        &quot;house-boy&quot;.&nbsp; One
        of the very necessary and regular jobs of the boy was to keep the big
        Rectory supplied with domestic water.&nbsp; This operation was via a large cast iron and lead pump, which had
        to be manually worked to feed the well water into the header tanks -
        this involved thousands of pump strokes each tank filling.&nbsp; Other jobs for the &quot;house-boy&quot; (often of school age)
        included shoe cleaning and lawn mower pulling. The large lawns of the
        Rectory were used for ball games, motorised or power mowers had not yet
        arrived on the garden scene, and as mowers were large and heavy it
        required the gardener to do the pushing while the boy, harnessed in
        front, did the pulling. One of the garden features of the Rectory (now
        the Old Rectory built in 1841) was the large Copper Beech on the North
        front lawn.<o:p>

        close tag on the village men as they went from the village to serve in
        the armed forces.&nbsp; By January 1915 the number was 31.&nbsp; All names were inscribed on a 'Roll of
        Honour' as they
        went away, and this Roll was placed and exhibited in the Church. Miss
        Colley busied herself by collecting eggs for wounded soldiers in
        Northampton and London Hospitals; the quantity collected was 48 per
        week, but Miss Colley often had to make up the total quantity herself,
        and was never slow in reminding the donors of their obligations.&nbsp; Miss
        Colley was also the originator of the first <a href="../Miscgroups.htm#mu"> Blisworth Mothers' Union</a> in
        1917 - having first suggested it in 1915. Mrs. W. Harris, who now lives with her husband in Mount Pleasant
        Cottages in the Courteenhall Road, was a founder member, as well as
        being the first bride to be married by the new Rector.<o:p>

        advancing years of the war the Rector became very involved with Home
        Defence. He was one of the leaders of the Training Corps, and was a
        drill instructor. Other instructors were Mr. A. Green, the schoolmaster, and Mr. A. Howe, farmer of Lodge Farm.&nbsp;
        In May 1915 the Rector shepherded the Blisworth Contingent of
        that early &quot;Dads' Army&quot; to Easton Neston for a combined
        exercise with the Towcester Troop. The Rector later logged: &quot;We

        The Rector took
        an active part in the original Blisworth Troop of Boy Scouts, which in
        those early days had as assistants Tom Whitlock and Harry Monk. One
        village boy was even given the Christian Name Walter Baden-Powell.&nbsp;
        In June 1915 the
        Troop received a visit from the District Commissioner who was prompted
        to &quot;make some useful hints&quot; regarding the uniforms worn.&nbsp;
        He also stressed the importance of Scouting in relation to the
        seemingly inevitable calls to serve in the Armed Forces.&nbsp; By August of 1915, Patrol Leader Ronald Freeston was dispatched
        to Andersby on the East Coast to partake in a Coast Guard Exercise.<o:p>

        conducted a Junior Guild of St. John the Baptist at which much
        instruction was given on temperance.&nbsp; Mrs. H. Wallington, the wife of the &quot;Royal Oak&quot;
        landlord was a keen helper and temperance worker. At those evening
        meetings the Rector sometimes brought his gramophone, complete with
        its magnificent horn.&nbsp; Classical
        music was played.&nbsp; During
        Lent the Guild members were shown lantern slides telling the story of the
        Pilgrim's Progress.&nbsp; The
        Rector provided the large &quot;Magic Lantern&quot; illuminated by
        acetylene gas, which was generated in a large container standing beside
        the Lantern.&nbsp; This holder
        also held the water supply which was drip fed on to the carbide lumps.&nbsp;
        If the water was turned on too much, an overdose of gas was
        produced which pressurised the water causing loud gurgles and bangs,
        flooding the surrounding floor space.&nbsp; I sometimes think that the irregularities of the &quot;Magic
        Lantern&quot; must have caused more entertainment than the actual slides shown!
        To send the juniors home in a happy mood, the Rector showed some of his
        &quot;real magic&quot; mechanical motivated slides, when 'funny-men'
        actually lifted their arms and legs up and down!<o:p>

        Sunday School continued unabated during the war years, with a friendly
        rivalry from the Baptist Sunday School.&nbsp; A typical Sunday for the children of the Church congregation
        consisted of Sunday School Assembly in the Old School, then walking in a
        long crocodile down &quot;The Alley&quot; (new called Church
        Lane) to Morning Service at Church.&nbsp; Choir boys were allowed to run ahead to don their Surplices and
        Cassocks.&nbsp; The Sunday School
        Scholars were spared the sermons, for during the hymn prior to the
        sermon, all children so wishing to leave the Church, were allowed to do
        so.&nbsp; After the heavy Sunday
        dinner, which was often collected by children from the Village bakehouse,
        there followed Sunday School again at 2pm.&nbsp; Many children also went to Evensong at 6pm, followed by hymn
        singing at home around the piano, or wheezy harmonium.&nbsp; And so to bed.<o:p>

        to enjoy the &quot;best of two worlds&quot; in the shape of an extra tea
        party or outing.&nbsp; At one
        wartime tea party held on the Rectory Lawn, the Rector launched some hot
        air paper Zeppelins causing (so it was said) consternation in Germany !!&nbsp;
        Each child, on going home, was presented with a small present,
        plus the inevitable village-made currant bun. The Choir and Ringers also
        enjoyed their annual outings, either going by train from Blisworth

        Many tenants did so, but even though a cottage might sell for as
        little as £100 or less, it was more than the cottager had.&nbsp; Some cottagers had to raise a mortgage on a £100, and it

        was fond of relating a story of his Cambridge days of when the Composer,
        DVORAK, came to receive an honorary degree, and was too poor to buy a
        gown for the occasion, many &quot;hard-up&quot; sympathetic students

        village Oddfellows Club, the two parsons walked at the head of the Feast
        Sunday Church Procession.&nbsp; Behind
        them followed the officials of the Club and the great club banner, so

        amongst the workers and to offer, through weekly members' contributions,
        cash payments when such members fell ill, or on hard times of
        unemployment.&nbsp; One such club
        was the Ancient Order of Odd Fellows (Manchester Unity Friendly
        Society), each branch being given an extra name of identification.&nbsp;
        Bliswarth formed <a href="../Sun-Moon&#32;and&#32;Stars/Records/OF-Records.htm"> a branch of this Club</a> and was given the identity
        &quot;Loyal Travellers Home Lodge No. 2645&quot; and commenced around
        1841.&nbsp; As it was a non
        political and non sectarian society, its members (males only at first) came from
        all walks of village life.&nbsp; It
        was often referred to as the working men's 'Masonic Society'.&nbsp; A juvenile branch was formed in
        1889.<o:p>&nbsp;
        From an early
        date the Club adopted the Parish Church for its Annual Parade and
        Service.&nbsp; As with many other

        Blisworth in October, much to the regret of the congregation and the

        and then moved on to Bonnington near to Ashford in Kent, where he had
        charge of three small parishes.&nbsp; He
        retired in the summer of 1939 and took a flat with his family on the sea
        front at Deal.&nbsp; The former
        village Doctor was already there in Deal in retirement - Doctor and Mrs.
        Jeaffreson. When the 1939 war was declared, the civilian population
        was evacuated from the sea front, and the Colley family moved down to
        St. Austell, Cornwall, where he had held his first curacy,
        and in 1943 he bought a house in London where he died on April 7th,

        We now come to
        our 51st recorded Rector, the Rev. George Hall Mallett, MA., who was
        inducted in December 1928. There had not been a long interregnum,
        and the new Rector and his wife Louisa were soon settled in the Rectory.&nbsp;
        They were also speedily involved in parish affairs, for Christmas
        was near at hand. It is just possible that the Rectory had been wired up
        for electricity, for this new power came to Blisworth in 1927.&nbsp; Incidentally, a fortnightly door-to-door refuse collection was instituted in
        1928.&nbsp; So one can only say
        that they almost had a Rectory serviced by all the new
        &quot;mod-cons&quot;. They had no family, but the Rectory was smoothly run by a cook-housekeeper and day woman, plus a
        gardener/chauffeur.<o:p>

        was born at Heanor, Derbyshire, on December 28th 1873 - his father was
        a clergyman. He graduated at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, in 1901, followed by
        Curacies at Worthing, Brighton, Newhaven and Broadwater. He became
        Vicar of Chudleigh in Devon in 1916 where he remained up to 1928.<o:p>&nbsp;
        The Rectory
        became a gracious haven, set behind the great copper beach tree which
        stood on the North front lawn, tennis was enjoyed parochially on the
        South lawn, and regular garden parties and Church Fetes were also held
        in the grounds.<o:p>

        considerably shorter in stature than his wife and when he first came to
        Blisworth he wore a traditional clerical black hat of a slightly earlier
        period, for the hat had a very shallow crown of about 2&quot; high. His
        face was small and he wore upon his nose a pair of pince-nez spectacles
        which were forever in need of adjustment.&nbsp; He also wore an extra deep clerical collar which rather
        emphasised the smallness of his face. He was, however, a great humorist,
        and encouraged all social activities.&nbsp; At an early meeting with Parishioners at the Rectory, and while
        standing at the North Porch he asked a by­stander &quot;what trees are
        they?&quot;&nbsp; to which
        question the answer was simply &quot;Elders&quot;.&nbsp; The Rector's comment was &quot;So they are!&nbsp;

        homemade sketch was a parody of village life.&nbsp; One of the 'actors'
        taking the part of the Rector borrowed the shallow crowned hat from the
        Rev. Mallett. The sketch proved a great success and the Rector and his
        wife seemingly fully enjoyed it.&nbsp; But the flat hat was never worn
        again

        in the Church, many members paying for a light fitment at approximately
        £3. The Church clock had also come to the end of its &quot;ticks&quot;,
        and the Rector, remembering that his former parish of Chudleigh had a
        clock for sale, suggested that we buy it and install it at Blisworth.
        The clock was duly bought for £25, and this same Chudleigh

        6th, 1935 - a lovely sunshine warm day. Following a special Service of
        Thanksgiving in Church at 1.30pm, everyone marched down to the Mill
        Green at West Bridge, headed by the band and the 'Oddfellows' Banner.
        The planting of trees was carried out with due ceremony.&nbsp; First the Girl Guides' tree was planted by Mrs. M. Clinch,
        then the Boy Scouts' tree by Mr. Woolacott; the Rector planted the
        'village' tree, and a fourth tree was planted by Mr. T. Sturgess on
        behalf of the Parish Council.&nbsp; Initially
        the County Council had refused permission<o:p>
        for these trees
        to be planted - but thanks to their change of heart the four trees now
        present a pleasant feature at the approach of the village as one comes from

        wonderful radio, which brought the description of the splendid
        ceremonies in London right into our houses. Thus our own village
        rejoicings did not begin until 2pm, when a United Service was held in
        Church. Then followed sports, maypole dancing, and a physical training
        display at the Council School.&nbsp; A
        free meat tea was then enjoyed.&nbsp; This
        meal was undertaken in relays - first the elders of the village - next
        the children, who were also presented with a &quot;Coronation Mug&quot;
        - and then the village people in general partook of the meal, which
        was served by the willing matrons of the village.&nbsp; Dancing followed, but
        the grand firework display had to be postponed owing to rain.&nbsp; A tree to mark the occasion was planted by the Women's Institute.
        This beech tree, now growing apace, stands in the field just
        around the Elm Tree Corner in the Northampton Road, and opposite to Mr.

        This month I
        intend to digress a little and take stock of the village during the Rev.
        Mallett's time at Blisworth. The population was around 800 who ware
        housed in approximately 247 houses, of which 74 had thatched roofs.&nbsp;
        It
        was not until 1933 that the first of the Council Houses ware built,
        which are the eight situated in the Courteenhall Road, opposite to
        the School.&nbsp; Then followed
        the four in Chapel Lane, and as they were built in 1937 they were
        named &quot;Coronation Cottages&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1938 the long row of 29 houses were built higher up in the
        Courteenhall Road.&nbsp; Sadly,
        many fine old cottages were demolished during this period, but a few
        were reconditioned by a special grant which did not have to exceed £100&nbsp;

        Before closing
        the chapters on the Rev. G.H. Mallett MA., our Rector 1928-1939, I
        would like to add a few more words on patronage which has been the topic
        of previous notes.&nbsp; Little then was I aware of the
        impending historic events which occurred on February 7th 1975.<o:p>&nbsp;
        Seemingly the
        Church leaders have debated the patronage laws for the past forty years,
        many condemning the age old archaic system of private patronage and
        calling for a change in the laws. Thus it was that on February 7th the
        Church of England Central Synod (or Church government) of Westminster
        voted by 228 votes&nbsp; against 51, to give parishes and interested
        parties the right to form a new appointment partnership with the
        Bishops, former patrons and the Parochial Church Councils.<o:p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Legislation
        has now to be prepared for Parliament to agree; this will probably
        contain the wording &quot;Patrons will be stripped of their ancient
        legal and absolute rights to present and appoint clergymen&quot;... thus
        bringing to an end the so called 1500 years old &quot;Squires Reign&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In its place a novel dual system will take over. Alternative
        &quot;A&quot; will give disenfranchised patrons a chance to register,
        which will allow them a share in selection along with the parishioners,
        and<o:p>
        dispense
        with the patron, but again former patrons could well be included amongst
        the three selectors, being second nominees to the Parochial Church
        Councils.<o:p>&nbsp; At
        present one in five of the clergy are still appointed by private
        patrons. These can vary from Company Directors, Local Authorities, a
        Racecourse Company, as well as Dukes and religious orders. None need to
        be Anglicans let alone Christians.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">The
        replacement of the age old system of Patronage will take time and many
        more words and discussions, but come it will. It is said that a new
        thinking about the Church is emerging in which the Holy Spirit is
        directing the Church to rediscover the biblical principles on which it
        should be based.<o:p>

        conclude the notes on patronage I will give a brief list of names of
        past Patrons of the Blisworth Church, which will illustrate the very
        varied and often tumultuous times which not only our country has passed
        through but also that the Church has always moved too.<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">The
        Right of Presentation to the Church (Blisworth) was granted to William
        Briwerre by the Earl of Derby, and confirmed by King John in 1199.&nbsp;
        The advowson passed with the manor to Baldwin Wake on the death
        of Joan Briwerre, and the Blisworth Patronage remained &quot;on and
        off&quot; in the hands of the Wake family until 1523.<o:p>&nbsp; The
        next recorded name after Baldwin Wake is Edward I, who acts as custodian&nbsp;for the infant heir of John Wake deed. Next King Edward II
        takes over, with a period when Queen Isabella moves in. Thomas Wake then
        comes on the scene followed by Blanche de Wake.<o:p>&nbsp; A
        Thomas de Hollande, Earl of Kent, is next on the list, and after his
        death Alicia, Countess of Kent, (his wife) becomes Patron. Then follow
        Johanna, Countess of Kent and Lady Wake.&nbsp; After a gap, the next Patron to be named is Henry Grey, Earl of
        Tankerville. In 1472 George, Duke of Clarence, is named.<o:p>&nbsp; Then
        a Thomas Wake returns to the scene followed by Roger Wake Esq., who died
        in 1504 and is buried in Blisworth Church, leaving as a great memorial
        his fine table tomb on which are the brasses of himself and his wife
        Elizabeth plus his many children.&nbsp; As
        Elizabeth remains at Blisworth for a time, she becomes the next named
        patron.&nbsp; In 1523 the
        Blisworth Manor is sold and Elizabeth has married Earl Grey of Dorset. A
        John Grey Kt. is the next Patron; this could indicate that Elizabeth
        died before her second husband and thus he became patron until his
        death. Edmund Knyghtley Kt. is the next on the list, for it was he who
        purchased the Blisworth Manor.&nbsp; After
        that we have a regal list, for Henry VIII comes into the picture, fallowed by Queen Mary and her husband Phillip
        II of Spain. After certain political differences, Queen Elizabeth is
        Patron, followed by Christopher Hatton Kt. of Kirby Hall.<o:p>&nbsp; From
        1664 the list is as follows:&nbsp; John
        Clement, Esq: Joseph Knibb, Gentleman: Wil Roberts Gent, and Physician:
        William Earl of Hatton: Chas. Hen. Lord of Hatton: George Finch Hatton.&nbsp;
        Then follow the members of the Barry Family, and from 1930 the
        details of our Patrons were given in the two previous notes.<o:p>

        Since last August
        I have attempted to tell a little about our 51st recorded Rector.&nbsp; I think that those pre-war days and years ware in general happy
        ones. Wages were low - £3
        being a good wage for a man - but commodities were also priced low in
        relation. Many cottagers owned their own properties which they had&nbsp;
        purchased when the village was sold up in 1920, and rented
        properties were so low that to be a landlord of any one of them was
        often an embarrassment.<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">With the gas
        supply coming to the village around 1934, home cooking became a general
        daily routine. Previously, Sunday dinners were carried to the village
        bakehouse where they were baked in the large oven. <i>At first in Stoke
        Road <a href="../Early&#32;Industry/Baking/bakery.htm">and later</a> in
        the High Street.</i>&nbsp; It was a common
        practice for children when going to Sunday School to take the uncooked
        meal, and then afterwards collect the large tin in which sat the superb
        roast joint which was surrounded by the traditional &quot;Yorkshire
        Pudding&quot;; a cloth was taken to cover the whole tin and contents,
        and all the family was ready assembled to receive the one special meal
        of the week.&nbsp; It was from that same bakehouse oven that the late Mr.
        Sturgess and his son William also produced the finest &quot;Hot Cross
        Buns&quot; on Good Friday - and they were really HOT, besides which the
        cost of twelve buns then was one old shilling. The same value -
        5p - for ONE bun was the price on this Good Friday!<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">At the Rectory
        conditions were slightly different. The staff comprised a
        cook-housekeeper
        (who ultimately married the Sexton, then a widower), a parlour maid and
        a daily woman. The outside staff consisted of the chauffer-gardener,
        with occasional help from the Sexton who not only was the village
        carpenter/handyman, but the undertaker as well. One of <a href="../Audio/audio.htm"> his favourite
        sayings</a> was: &quot;I baptise 'em, marry 'em and bury 'em.&quot;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">The relations
        between the Church and Chapel were fully exploited and enjoyed; upkeep
        of both buildings being no problem.&nbsp; The Church congregations were satisfactory and there was a goodly
        choir and team of ringers. Parishioners were often entertained to
        musical evenings at the Rectory, the accompaniment to the songs being
        provided by either Mrs. Mallett or a visiting pianist, the piano being a
        &quot;grand&quot; of fine tone. Little then did we imagine that we were
        seeing the passing of an era handed down from the Victorian days of a
        well appointed residence filled with family treasures, and a Rector and
        his wife who, besides the stipend, each had a comfortable private
        income, which rendered no problems in staffing or heating the big
        Rectory. Each morning the whole household would assemble for prayers
        which were conducted by the Rector; then followed the daily routine,
        much of which was directed by Mrs. Mallett, who so often in her quick
        patter commenced her comments to her husband with
        &quot;George...George...&quot;, the reply being &quot;yes, dear?&quot;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">One item
        worthy of mention was a large decorative banner or panel of Chinese silk
        embroidery which hung on the wall in the drawing room. This panel was a
        'relic' collected by a former family member from China during
        the Boxer uprising (see note below).&nbsp; Boxers were a section of Chinese who in 1896 rose against foreigners and
        were guilty of many massacres and atrocities, the movement being
        especially directed against missionaries. A combined European force was
        sent out against the Boxers in 1900 and not only was the rising
        suppressed but large indemnities were demanded and conceded.<o:p>&nbsp; Not knowing which member brought
        this fine work of art out of China, I can only mention that one of Mr.
        Mallett's sisters married a Major Boswell (who was a direct descendant
        of the famous James Boswell who wrote the classic biography of Doctor
        Johnson). Thus there could have been a military connection with the
        collection of the embroidery, or, alternatively, a Mallett member could
        have been out in China as a missionary at the time of the Rising - but
        this is only conjecture an my part.&nbsp; All that I was told was that the tapestry was brought out of
        China during the Boxer Rising, by a family member.</o:p>

        centuries there have bean certain theological divisions between the
        clergy of the Church of England, and which caused many of our parsons to
        be labeled &quot;high&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;low&quot;
        churchmen. Writers of the 18th Century and into the 19th century, loved
        to lampoon the parsons, and many cartoonists and artists, such as Thomas
        Rowlandson, have left behind a great number of impressions of
        &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; Rectors. The &quot;high&quot;
        church person was invariably shown as a very well fed, well clothed, and
        rotund gentleman, while his opposite, the &quot;low&quot; parson, was
        often pictured as under­fed, ill-dressed, which, more times than not,
        was attributed to his giving monies away charitably more than his meagre
        stipend could allow.<o:p>

        exception of the Rev. W.W. Colley (1914-1928) Blisworth appears to
        have enjoyed a long run of &quot;low&quot; churchmanship; the Rev. W.W.
        Colley styling himself as an Anglo-Catholic, which also introduced to
        the church a certain amount of ceremony. His successor, the Rev. G.
        Mallett, who is the subject of this series of notes, swung the pendulum
        back to an evangelical or &quot;low&quot; church.&nbsp; At one time the Rev. G. Mallett was Curate at Broadwater for
        14 years; on his promotion to Rector of Chudleigh in Devon, he
        stated that he had had little chance of promotion except through the
        Trustees of a private evangelical patronage, which, in all probability
        was the main reason for his coming to Blisworth in 1928 (for the sale of
        the Patronage could have been in process at that time).<o:p>

text-autospace:none"><font color="#000080">Mr. Mallett was a
        great visitor (remember that the village was then less than half the
        size of the present Blisworth) and as often as not he wore a rather long
        Burberry fawn raincoat, the pockets of which were most accommodating in
        size for the many small gifts which he carried with him. Those gifts
        comprised
        fruits in season, eggs, and often small posies of flowers which somehow
        he extracted undamaged from those spacious pockets. These gifts in turn
        were handed out with a certain shyness to those whom he visited, but
        they were always received with good grace.<o:p>

        the Rectory in those days was by a more lengthy driveway which was
        flanked on the street side by a laurel and lilac shrubbery.&nbsp; On the church­yard side there was a narrow flower border fronted
        by an ancient box hedge.&nbsp; It
        was from that border that he gathered the double snowdrops and anemones
        for his springtime pocket posies; later in season that border was taken
        over by masses of woodland ferns. Fronting the Rectory was the pride and
        joy of the village i.e. the great copper beech tree which has been
        mentioned many times already in these notes - besides which, it was the
        only copper beech in the Parish.<o:p>&nbsp;<i> It seems we need to fin

        had a brief illness caused, it was said, by
        his visiting in the bad weather and he died on Feb. 1st 1939, and was

        reminder that this year is Architectural Heritage Year, and what better
        than to take brief stock of the village.&nbsp; Firstly I would recommend that all readers take a walk up the
        Gayton Road and then, on turning about, take a slow walk back home.&nbsp;
        This walk MUST be on a bright sunny evening when the sun is
        casting long low shadows, and when every section of the Western face of
        Blisworth is bathed in a supreme glow of warm bright light. To the older
        villagers they will miss many former buildings; to the new residents
        they should (I trust) find great joy and aesthetic values presented to
        them from such a vantage point, and further, that they will come to love
        the village of their choice mare and more as the years roll by.<o:p>

        side of the village the onlooker will see the attractive group of brick
        and stone buildings, dominated by the Church and Tower.&nbsp; The tower is younger than the Church body, having been added late
        in the 14th century, and it is that protrusion of stone work that
        catches the warm evening sun so dramatically, penetrating as it does
        through a sea of new green of Elm, Sycamore and Limes.&nbsp; (The spires and towers of the Northamptonshire Churches are most
        rewarding to the explorer and present a great variety of goodly
        heritage)&nbsp; From the time they were built, Church tower and spire have given great
        joy to the returning wanderer or pilgrim, and that is how we should feel
        about our Church tower whenever we espy it from the numerous approaches

        of such delights as of the distant view of Church and tower.&nbsp; Stand awhile, too, on the Gayton Road and think of the times from
        when that tower was built (a thousand Common Market problems have been
        re-enacted since then, and still the village and the Church have their
        being).&nbsp; Think too that
        where you live that others have been there for thousands of years,
        including the Romans. That continuity is OUR HERITAGE. Think too of the
        early plagues, the wars, the Blisworth men following their Squire,
        Roger Wake, to fight at Bosworth Field in 1485, and returning dejected
        at having been defeated. Think too of the changing scene of field and
        woodland, of peasant and Parson ever moving, by choice or by decree.
        Think too of the endless procession of people going to the Church for
        Baptisms, Marriages and Burials - all recorded by the Church in the
        registers from mid 16th century.&nbsp; That tower, too, was seldom silent, for within its walls are five bells.&nbsp;
        In 1552 there were three &quot;greate bell and a sanctus
        bell&quot;.&nbsp; A bell was also
        rung for &quot;Curfew&quot; (meaning 'cover the fire!) this
        being around 8pm when the cottagers had to put out their
        fires by low. Great peals were rung out for national rejoicings, a
        practice which is very English.&nbsp; Then a peel was rung at 8 am to tell
        the cottagers that the cornfields had been gathered in and that gleaning
        could begin. Up and into this century the 'dinner bell' was rung at
        noon, and also up until recent times the Death Knell Bell was sounded -
        thrice three tolls were given for a<o:p>&nbsp; . . . (<i>unfortunately

        our Church tower could tell, but I must stop now.&nbsp; There is just one
        thing more. The Patron Saint of our Church is St. John the Baptist,
        whose birthday we celebrate on June 24th.&nbsp; That day and a series of
        following days was the one big holiday for the Blisworth folk over the
        long history of our Church.&nbsp; Great
        were the festivities around &quot;The Feast&quot; - &quot;Blisworth

        the PARISH COUNCIL towards their fund for the much needed restoration of
        the Old School.&nbsp; Of the total sum, £35 was received by a most generous
        donation.<o:p>&nbsp; The Walks began
        at the Great Barn situated at the Village approach from Northampton, and
        which carries the date-stone G.B. 1633 - the G.B. standing for George
        Bland, the builder of the barn and who also is recorded as a
        Churchwarden of that time.<o:p>&nbsp; The tour then
        took stock of all properties around the 'old' Elm Tree junction. This

        done to either of the village houses of worship.&nbsp; Apart from a few broken windows, a damaged greenhouse, and

        the bomb was removed and exploded in the lime stone quarry. On August
        23rd an enemy Dornier strafed Blisworth Station but again there were

        the Church had a near miss when around 50 incendiaries fell in the

        fell and exploded in a rough parallel to the Stoke Road, one dropping on
        an allotment plot (and the onions) on what is now Greenside, and the
        other nearer to the village at the rear of the British Bacon Factory off
        Stoke Road which destroyed some nearby greenhouses - now the site of
        Home Close.<o:p>&nbsp; On November 1941,
        one of our own aircraft, a Blenheim bomber, crashed and burst into
        flames in the fields behind the Courteenhall Road huuses. The crew of
        three were rescued and taken to Northampton Hospital, thus giving the
        Blisworth Wardens an insight into further action. Blisworth Station and
        the area around later received a fair quota of HE and incendiary bombs,
        the fire bombs doing a certain amount of damage to rolling stock on the
        line and burning a few sleepers etc.<o:p>&nbsp; Overall the
        village was very fortunate, and when the war was over, both Church and
