        Sunday, April 2012 - Village Parade</span></font></font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Our
        new Rector, Mrs. Andrea Watkins, at St John the Baptist's Church in Blisworth began the
        religious celebration of Easter this year with a parade on Palm Sunday,
        the start of Holy Week.&nbsp; The plan was to have a donkey in recall for part of Jesus' triumphal journey into Jerusalem
        where he rode a
        donkey (Matthew 21:1-9).&nbsp; The Palm leaves laid at his feet to
        soften the harsh track surface have never been a feature of celebrations
        in this country but in Medieval times some fronds of &quot;Pussy
        Willow&quot; were traditionally used, being the first in Spring to
        blossom, the custom is thought to have originated with Slavic people.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">&nbsp;Quite
        a considerable crowd joined in the procession, which began where
        Buttmead joins Conegar Leys and proceeded down Buttmead.&nbsp; There was
        a momentary hesitation at the entrance to Church Lane.&nbsp; This was
        because for much of
        the walk the donkey, actually it was a local pony, had just one walking
        &quot;gear&quot; and had got well ahead of the main procession.&nbsp; It
        had disappeared down Church Lane by the time the column arrived and
        there was a debate, led by the Rector (seen on the left, below) on whether to follow the originally designated route
        (Stoke Road, High Street and through the Church Yard) despite the
        feeling expressed that it would be hazardous due to traffic.&nbsp; In
        the end, the procession struck up again and carried on down Church Lane,
        following the pony.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Albeit,
        a parade of modest size, let's hope that this sets a new precedent -
        after all 2012 is a Jubillee year and an Olympic one.&nbsp; The last
        ones in the village go back to when The Feast Day, typically 28 July,
        was regularly celebrated in the early 1970s.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
