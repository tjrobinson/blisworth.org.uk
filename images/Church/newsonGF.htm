<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><b><font color="#000080">SAID OF
THE EXHIBITION (Chronicle &amp; Echo) - </font></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">&quot;Very
few local villages indeed could mount an exhibition of local life and crafts to
rival that which may be seen in Blisworth parish church during afternoons and
evenings until next Monday.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">&quot;That
Blisworth is able to present such a rewarding view of its history, especially of
the last couple of hundred years, is due to the intense interest in its affairs
of Mr. George Freeston around whom has accumulated an extraordinary miscellany
of artifacts. The present exhibition is 99 per cent his collection, coming as a
matter of fact, from under his bed, although one thing notably absent among all
the pots and pans, is the receptacle one might expect to find beneath the bed
of, with respect, an old-fashioned countryman. However this omission may soon be
remedied. He was, at least, recently told of the presence in the village of a
closet which flushed by an emission of sand (a sand closet as opposed to a water
closet) and one hopes that this too may eventually find its way into the
collection. It needs little imagination to conjure up the activities which
called into employment the household and farming implements, the dairying
equipment, beautiful churns and ladles and butter pats and the barrel-making tools
of the cooper. Looking at the flat irons, the washboard, the purposeful
carpentry of the washing dollies, bleached in dunking the dust from countless
village shirts, one is ready to concede that the washing machine brought about a
great revolution, although, alas, not a quiet one.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">&quot;And
wouldn't meat, roasted before a fire in the Dutch oven which Mr. Freeston
exhibits be more succulent more deliciously aromatic than the modern, relatively
high-speed Sunday joint for which some or us pause? In more recent times faces
emerge from the past in a remarkable assortment or village photographs including
school classes and football teams. Canal life is not overlooked. The colourful
paraphernalia of the narrow boats reminds one of the excellent British Waterways
museum nearby at Stoke Bruerne. What has been accomplished there allows one to
hope that something will be done to make Mr. Freeston's collection permanently
available to the public.</font></p>
