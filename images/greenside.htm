        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publicationor using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        <p align="center"><b>There are two notable things about Greenside.</b></p>
        <p>One is that, once settled in, the residents formed a social club in
        1977 - see copy below.&nbsp; No other part of the village had done so
        before then and they were one of the first to use the new <a href="Articles/village_hall.htm">Village
        Hall</a>.</p>
        <p>The other is that the <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Ironstone-part1.htm"> ironstone mining</a> took its toll on the housing
        of Blisworth for the first time.&nbsp; Acme had built on ground that had
        not been allowed to settle for long enough; houses began to show
        distortion and one or two needed to be rebuilt.&nbsp; The buck passed
        back and forth but seemed to rest mostly with the builders for not digging
        deeply enough to avoid such problems - they were not allowed to build
        any more houses in the village.&nbsp; All the houses were eventually cured of
        all their 'ills'.</td>
