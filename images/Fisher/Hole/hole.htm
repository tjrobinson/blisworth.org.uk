        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">It is
        nearly 4 years since the last ground subsidence in Blisworth which was
        due to the collapse of a canal drainage culvert <a href="../../Canal/Candle-hole/hole.htm"> near to Candle
        Bridge</a>.
        The cause of this new problem is not easy to determine at this early
        stage as it is presently a hole, sized only about six inches, located
        near to known workings which would both be dated from about 1800.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>Jan
        9, 2013</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hole was discovered by Mrs. Timmins on the
        6th of January and the Canal and Rivers Trust were notified. <b> C&amp;RT</b>
        duly fenced off the hole, noting that someone had bravely tested the
        hole depth by inserting a 12 foot long spar of wood into it. That is the
        piece of wood shown in the inset photo on the left. The location of the
        hole shown as a small blue dot is very near to the assumed line of the
        Fisher Brook culvert (pale red band) and to the location of a 1976
        ground collapse that has been associated with early attempts to
        establish a line for the tunnel. There is further <a href="../../Tunnel&#32;Story/photographs.htm#D">information
        on this collapse</a> which included the loss of an electricity <a href="../../Tunnel&#32;Story/photographs.htm#Dcollapse">distribution
        pole</a> at the approximate location ringed in red. (The historical
        account of the establishment of a successful line for the tunnel,
        written by Tony Marsh, is to be <a href="../../Tunnel&#32;Story/Tunnel-Story.htm">found
        here</a> - but, for now, that background may well be irrelevant).</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The loss
        of soil leading to a cavitation which has worked its way up to the
        surface could be either due to a breach in the culvert or to some
        1795-1800 exploratory excavation (labelled <b>D</b> in the <a href="../../Tunnel&#32;Story/Tunnel-Story.htm">history
        account</a>) that has been damaged by the movement of rainwater over the
        past 200 years.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"> The responsibility for exploring and dealing with
        this hazard has not been establish yet.&nbsp; The hole, probably made by
        a lucky horse, is centred on a public bridleway leading to Nunn Wood. It
        is estimated at 107m above sea level compared to the canal at 90m, the
        possible maximum depth of the old exploration also at 90m and the
        culvert at an estimated 95m.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"> These numbers, in combination with the fact
        that the nearest horizontal approach of the tunnel is around 60 metres,
        suggest that the collapse is due to soil erosion around the culvert
        which may well be still intact. The crude cross-section drawing below
        shows what is in mind. The arrow labelled 'w' is an assumed flow of
        water which has caused progressive collapse above the culvert until a
        cavern reaches the surface. The tunnel is too far away to be directly
        affected but has problems of its own; disintegrating brickwork because
        of the ingress of water.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>Jan
        19, 2013</b>&nbsp; The Canals and Rivers Trust have inspected the hole,
        enlarged the opening and determined that maybe 20 tonnes of rubble and
        soil will fill it in - for the sake of safety. They plan to do this by
        wheel-barrowing from a lorry backed into the cul-de-sac pathway.&nbsp;
        In the meantime a second hole has been found in the field. This is
        already fenced off and is beside the first ventilator shaft, not directly over
        the tunnel but close (a fair way to the south of the bottom edge of this map).
        This collapse is significant in that it suggests that there is
        considerable water-cored soil removal from either above/around the
        tunnel or around the ventilator shaft.</span></font></p>
