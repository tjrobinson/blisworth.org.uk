        <b> G3881</b>, NRO, specifies the leasehold farms for 1705 and the picture alongside shows
        the entry for Blisworth.&nbsp; It mentions 65 acres for the farm
        associated with the manor, including a few specific fields; Holme,
        Reeves &amp; Meadow &amp; Stoney Closes - none of which are names
        carried into 19th century maps.&nbsp; The Lound and The Park are notable
        however.&nbsp; The passage of interest here is highlighted:&nbsp; &quot;..all manner of pools and stews ... the great pool near the mill
        and the great pool called Young's Pool...&quot;<br>
        <b>It is <u>Young's Pool</u> that requires explanation.&nbsp; </b>All
        that can be found of a Young family is a Mary Young who was married of
        this parish in the mid-17th century.&nbsp; There is no way of knowing
        whether the family were landowners, or pool owners.&nbsp; So, looking at
        the geography alone: in the
        path of streams in the parish, excluding the mill pool, there is only
        that part referred to later as Fishweir or Fisher Close that could be a
        candidate.&nbsp; It is the field
        immediately south of the tunnel entrance.&nbsp; A spring <a href="../Bridges-history.htm"> referred to in
        1718</a> as South Gutter spring, now known as Fisher Brook, runs through the
        western part of Fisher Close before running into a brick culvert built
        by the canal tunnel engineers in c.1800.&nbsp; At one time, up to around
        1700, there must presumably have been a large pool in Fisher Close as suggested by
        the shaded area in the map below.&nbsp; The pool would have been used
        for fish farming and would have various fish traps, or fish weirs.&nbsp;
        It would not have been enough to have merely widened the stream and
        applied a weir.&nbsp; Fish farming requires a pool deep enough to
        protect against herons and this could have only been provided with the
        accumulation of water &nbsp;&nbsp; </td>

        <p style="padding-left: 15; padding-right: 10"> over a year-round period including times the stream is full. In
        summer, the stream can be only an inch or two deep.&nbsp; <a name="embank"></a>Very probably
        the pool, essentially a manorial one, was developed in medieval times from natural undulations by means of a dam.<br>
        The canal tunnel
        engineers traversed the depression with a wide path for the <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/HillRailway.htm"> hill
        plateway</a> thus dividing the depression into two parts. The first
        photograph shows the larger of the two depressions with the well-defined
        edge of the path to the right (the lower of the two arrows in the map
        shows the approximate camera position).&nbsp; The terracing on the sides
        of the depression have been created by generations of sheep!&nbsp; There
        are more photos below of the embankment for the hill railway.&nbsp; It
        has been suggested by George Freeston and others that there must have
        been a collapse in the tunnel, or one of the earlier attempts, to
        explain the depression.&nbsp; This idea does not wash - the extent of
        the entire depression is <b>far too large</b>.&nbsp; One should compare
        the situation with the depressions in the field to the south of the
        Stoke Bruerne tunnel entrance - see the <a href="../Tunnel&#32;Story/Tunnel-Story.htm"> Tunnel

        The depression that was evident to the left of the
        railway embankment was over 20 feet deep.&nbsp; The second
        photograph shows the same field from a position in the &quot;Tunnel Car
        Park&quot;.&nbsp; In the early 1980s contractors Mowlems <a href="../Blistunnel.htm"> repaired the
        tunnel</a> and deposited hundreds of tonnes of rubble in the depression to
        the east of the hill plateway path thus levelling the field.&nbsp; The
        machine has just completed the return of the topsoil and presides over a
        rather inventive arrangement of gates and
        traffic control posts which were soon taken away.&nbsp; To the lower right of this picture is the
        steep path down to the tunnel entrance.
        <p style="padding-left: 15; padding-right: 5">There are pictures below, taken from a location on the plateway, a little to the
        north of the depressions shown in the map.&nbsp; One was taken in 1985
        and the other in 2006.
        <p style="padding-left: 15; padding-right: 5">The map here is accurate
        as regards the hill plateway with the implied division of a deep
        landscape that was once a pool. The extent of the pool is best suggested
        in a <a href="../Comp_Mapping/compmap.htm">new comparative map</a>.&nbsp;

        <a name="refill"></a>In February 2009 the culvert at the base of the &quot;hollow to the
        west&quot; became blocked with sticks and British Waterways folk let the
        water get too deep to work in.&nbsp; Much of the water goes to supply
        the locks at Stoke Bruerne, via the tunnel.
        <p>This picture gives some idea of the
        scope of the supposed old manorial fish pool.&nbsp; What you see here
        would have been less than a third of its extent in the 16th
        century.&nbsp; In about 1800 the building of the <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/HillRailway.htm">hill railway</a> 
        caused a considerable portion, to the left, to be filled in.</p>

      Apart from the fun enjoyed, there are distinct benefits from holding
      anniversary celebrations as we did for the completion of the <a href="../Anni-Reopen/25-anniversary.htm">1980s
      repairs</a> to the tunnel.&nbsp; The benefit was that two engineers (<font color="#000080">Roy
      Slocombe and John Woods from Mowlems) involved in the project gave a
      presentation.&nbsp; Included in that presentation there were two pictures
      that are shown below.&nbsp; The first is looking north across the large
      hollow in the field on the north of the hill railway and shows a dangerous
      subsidence at the first of the original access shafts.&nbsp; This
      subsidence was corrected and sealed meticulously with steel and concrete
      before the hollow was used to accommodate the thousands of tonnes of
      rubbish from the repairs.&nbsp; The hollow demonstrates at least half of
      the rather large size of the original fish pool.&nbsp; The second picture
      shows the hollow part filled with rubbish with the approximate location of
      the subsidence indicated with an arrow.&nbsp; From inspecting the right of
      this picture it becomes evident that the path for the railway could be
      described as a rather narrow earthen causeway.&nbsp; It is the only
      picture we have of the feature.</font>
