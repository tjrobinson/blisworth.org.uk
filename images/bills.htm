<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">This record is not particularly notable
in terms of village history but nevertheless<br>
conveys 1935 costs for food and services and suggests the extent of cooperation<br>
in the village needed to put this event on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The coloured-in picture
above shows<br>
the main class room at the school just before the children's party.&nbsp; Below
follows<br>
the bills/receipts.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="Bills-1935/1.jpg" width="400" height="656"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">At the corner of Stoke Road and High Street.&nbsp; Much
of this appears to be<br>
objects for prizes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/2.jpg" width="400" height="607"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The bakery next door to Jasmine Cottage, formerly in
Stoke Road</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/3.jpg" width="400" height="593"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A cottage in Stoke Road now known as No. 16.&nbsp; When
enquiring<br>
about the whereabouts of this shop, the lady with the answer recalls<br>
it very well - she was head girl at the school for a while and was given<br>
the job of preparing tea for the teachers.&nbsp; She would walk the longer<br>
distance to Abbott's for the plain tea rather than use the specially<br>
blended tea from Young's, which the teachers did not like!<br>
The
Abbott family
extended to another house very nearly opposite<br>
No. 16 and that is
probably where their coal merchant business was<br>
located.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/4.jpg" width="400" height="739"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In the Stoke Road on a large site which was formerly
occupied by the<br>
Westley bakery and first steam corn mill.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/5.jpg" width="400" height="629"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">High Street - see main &quot;Shops&quot; section</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/6.jpg" width="400" height="320"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A farmer with a small-holding at The Elm who rented
many grass fields<br>
along the Northampton Road - descendants are located at the Stoneworks<br>
Farm.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/7.jpg" width="400" height="445"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Asplin was based at Home Farm which was demolished to make way<br>
for Buttmead.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/8.jpg" width="400" height="618"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Next door to the Phillips newsagent, see the Shops
section - note how<br>
Walter
Alexander uses Alfred's, ie. his father's, receipt book.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/9.jpg" width="400" height="350"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The shop next to present day Thackstone Cottage, Stoke
Road ie.at<br>
No. 21.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/10.jpg" width="400" height="356"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thought to be opposite No. 16 Stoke Road.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/11.jpg" width="600" height="628"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Burbidge family ran a sawmill and carpenters and
wood fabrication business<br>
opposite the Church in High Street - note the comment
re. look for<br>
alternative estimates for the three
tree guards and note the next account<br>
&nbsp;which was accepted.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/12.jpg" width="400" height="340"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Garage, wheelwright and carpenter next to the post office.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/13.jpg" width="500" height="581"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The W Collings is almost certainly Winston Collings who
is an uncle to Brian Collings<br>
artist at Stoke Bruerne.&nbsp; He was probably involved by having a starters
pistol and<br>
was prepared to use it - in peace.&nbsp; There was a parish councillor W E
Collins who<br>
would surely be too well known for such a spelling mistake to occur.&nbsp; Note
there was<br>
a ladies branch of the organisers who were not reserved in their choice of
liquid<br>
refreshment, if 'on expenses' - while at the dance, a more public affair, we are
lead<br>
to believe that only fizzy drinks were made available, free.&nbsp; Pictures of
both the<br>
Committee and the Ladies group are image numbers <a href="Miscgroups.htm#jubillee" style="color: #FF0000">20-10
and 20-11</a>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/14.jpg" width="400" height="290"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This in relation to the use of Church and Chapel crockery etc.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/14A.jpg" width="400" height="243"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This is an example from a couple of dozen individual helpers'
expenses.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/15.jpg" width="400" height="231"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A band leader - obscure.&nbsp; Evidently the W E
Collins mentioned above was<br>
responsible for some, if not all, of the accounts - making the above assignment<br>
of the W Collings as Winston virtually certain.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/16.jpg" width="500" height="440"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">200 Enamelled Jubillee Mugs £5/9/2 - these of
standardised design were were given<br>
to all children at the time - along with an aluminium medal.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/17.jpg" width="400" height="289"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Advertisements costs arranged for seven appearances in
the Mercury - the ad. was to<br>
call for tenders for a band at the event.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img border="0" src="Bills-1935/18.jpg" width="500" height="388"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Such medals are a surprise - again, a picture of one
will be included if it can be found.<br>
It seems likely that there was a substantial sports meeting as part of the
celebrations but<br>
a quantity of 200 medals seemed excessive until someone who was a school boy at
the<br>
time pointed out that they were given to all school children.&nbsp; Sam Brown, the Publican<br>
who
evidently was sports organiser (he reimbursed for the starting pistol caps), remained<br>
at the
Royal Oak
until well into the 1950's.</font></p>
