        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;

        yard and a toilet along with a window at the top of the stairs
        inside.&nbsp; The chimney, which was probably for a &quot;copper&quot;
        was sealed off.&nbsp; The evidence of an old ridged shed, against the
        gable end of the house, suggests the location for one of the village
        cobblers who worked here - see below for details.&nbsp; In 1969 the later brick extensions were demolished and a

        Moon and Stars (see 31-01)</a> - and, ka. &quot;George&quot;, he was
        groom to Capt. Elmshirst.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister, Ada Mary, had married
        in 1910 a William Hill, cobbler. &nbsp; Ada died in 1916 of
        TB and William Hill remarried.&nbsp;William Hill set up a
        cobblers shop on the <a href="Highsttwo.htm">High Street (see 16-12a)</a>
        and died some time before 1952 leaving his second wife in the cottage
