        I was shown these remarkable portraits for the first time I was, to say
        the least, amazed at the beauty and extravagance of construction. <o:p>
        The
        fact that they were hand drawn and in colour amazed me further, but more
        than this they introduced me to a man who knew the intimate details of
        Scripture and applied them to his own life?<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><font color="#000080">In
        bringing to life various texts from the Bible, <a href="john_green.htm"> John Green</a> powerfully and
        dramatically confirms his reliance upon God for his everyday need. He
        emphasises the truth and reality of God as a guiding light bringing into
        sharp focus the power and truth of Scripture as a pattern for everyday
        life.<o:p>

        his opening portrait, a Title Page, John Green establishes his faith in and reliance
        upon the word of God.<o:p>&nbsp; As
        you browse these very significant portraits acknowledge the artistry and
        craftsmanship of this man, but also take time to appreciate his faith in
        God and his eagerness to share this with others by producing an
        illuminated sequence of portraits which identify the characteristics of
        the creator God.<o:p>

        course we do not know and shall probably never know the motive behind
        John’s creation of these portraits. Perhaps they are a picture of his
        life – the ups and downs, the joy and despair; perhaps too they
        reflect our own lives. <o:p>

        Interestingly, another word is repeated ‘seven’ times and of course
        the number ‘seven’ is used throughout scripture. This time he
        exhorts the ‘people’ to worship God, and to be happy in their
        worship. This is most unusual, since in those days of 1915, in the
        middle of WW1, life was anything but happy and worship services could be
        quite sombre. Here is a reflection of contemporary worship in renewed
