<p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">George Freeston's scrapbook, which he assembled in 1953, includes a
reference to a village cobbler by the name of John Green. Page 45
of the scrapbook carries a photograph of him, copied above, and a little booklet
of religious music and verse which he had written and entitled &quot;No. 18
One-only-One&quot;.&nbsp; This is just one of 20 sacred songs that were composed
and delightfully hand written in around 1877 in a plain notebook. No. 18 was
removed as a bound fold of pages from the notebook at some stage.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080"> From George's notes we know that he lived at the house now
numbered <a href="../Stokerd01.htm#cobbler">20 Stoke Road</a> and worked as a
cobbler in the shed attached to the gable-end of the house. The shed was
replaced shortly after WWII with a small yard and door but they gave way to a flat-roofed study and
bathroom area built by the present occupiers.&nbsp; There is nothing left of
Green's cobbling-shed but a mark on the wall in one old photograph. Nothing more
of John Green emerged from the collections at the NRO deposited by Freeston
executors.</font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">Through contacts made at Collingtree however, there appeared in the
summer of 2007 a John Green (J. J. Green) who knew that his family came from
Blisworth. He had a few photos and documents handed down to him from his father and a book of
illuminated prayers which the Blisworth John Green had crafted just prior to
WWI.&nbsp; J. J. Green also possessed the music notebook mentioned above.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080"> This prayer book was proof of the assertion by George that John Green was an
extremely talented calligrapher and graphic designer. George knew this because
he had 'borrowed' the illuminated book from J. J. Green's father and we are told
that it took quite some 'one-on-one pressure' exerted upon George to return it!
This is a scenario we have heard countless times before, of course.</font></p>

        <p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">J. J. Green has kindly allowed the scanning of many of the designs
from the illuminated book and has generously given his permission for the Pastor
of the Baptist Church, Mr. Ashworth, to incorporate some of <a href="prayers.htm"> the prayers into a new
panel</a> for the Chapel.&nbsp; John Green of Blisworth was in the Anglican Church.
However, his style and dedication to his religious works were typical more of a
        Baptist, being somewhat evangelistic. We can find no evidence of him being actually <i>closely</i> associated
with either church in the village but there is a record of his burial in the
        form of a handed-down document from W. Whitlock itemising burial costs,
        coffin and rector's fee, October 12, 1918.</font>

from the illuminated prayer book, which comprises over 100 pages of
approximately A4 size - a few used here on the left as decoration, there was once two
almanacs (miniature encyclopaedias) of which only the front few pages of the
larger one survives and some 50 music and verse scores all, probably, in the
possession of J. J. Green's father at one time.&nbsp;</font></td>

        <p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">The first reference to
        the Green family at Blisworth is for a Richard Green, born in Lois
        Weedon c. 1781 and married Elizabeth Branson of Lois Weedon - who died
        young at Lois Weedon.&nbsp; Richard Green was buried in Blisworth in 28
        July 1867.&nbsp; He should be designated Richard Green senior because he had a
        son also called Richard, born c. 1812.&nbsp; Richard junior first married
        in 1841 </font><font color="#000080">Mary Ann Gibbs
        (born in Blisworth on 9 Sept 1821) </font><font color="#000080">and had a son, <b> John Green</b>, who is the
        subject of this account</font><font color="#000080">.&nbsp; It seems probable that he was living in
        Blisworth by about 1840.&nbsp; He subsequently married </font><font color="#000080">Sarah Smith from
        Shutlanger in 1853 .&nbsp; The 1851 census of Blisworth is clear
        enough; Richard (a cordwainer), Mary (a bookbinder) and son John (aged
        7) lived at 20 Stoke Road, or thereabouts, along with two siblings,
        Joseph (4) and Elizabeth (1) and with the mother's sister Elizabeth
        Gibbs.&nbsp; The 1841 census normally fails to locate people accurately
        in Blisworth but this time we can see <i>two</i> Richard Greens, both
        aged 25, one at the Grafton Arms and the other at one of <a href="../Stokerd02.htm#green">the
        cottages 'On the Green'</a>.&nbsp; Both Richards live alone aged 25 and both are
        shoemakers and we can assume one of them is the father-to-be of John
        Green. </font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">Some notes in
        passing:&nbsp; <i>There is the intriguing possibility that Richard Green
        was doubly-enumerated.&nbsp; Although his father, Richard senior, was
        buried at Blisworth he lived elsewhere from 1841 to 1861.&nbsp; In
        1841 he is recorded as a shoemaker in Lois Weedon and as a shoemaker
        in&nbsp; Wappenham in 1851.&nbsp; In 1861, at 80 years, he is living in
        Wappenham with another son,
        William (a shoemaker) and is recorded a pauper.&nbsp; Note that John
        Green's mother Mary was a bookbinder.&nbsp; It seems likely that John Green gained
        some inspiration in calligraphy as a nine year old from his mother and,
        of course, experience in shoemaking
        craft from his father.&nbsp; Where his musical and poetic creativity
        came from is less obvious.</i></font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">Of John Green's
        personal life we know very little.&nbsp; If he kept diaries they have
        not survived.&nbsp; He married <font color="#000080" SIZE="3">in
        c.1864</font> Ann (Annie) (born 1842,
        Greens Norton and died Nov 1908 in Blisworth).&nbsp; Unfortunately there
        is no information on Annie's maiden name.&nbsp; They had a son Joseph
        George Green, born c. 1867.&nbsp; John worked for the railways for a
        spell as a time-keeper. He was keen on flowers also, as indicated by the
        photograph below, and he was a member of the committee for the Blisworth
        Flower Show of 1912.&nbsp; There is a photograph of this committee but
        it is damaged and we are unable to recognise him.&nbsp; However, Geo.
        Freeston on the back of the photograph writes his name in a sure hand.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">Joseph George Green
        (c.1867 -&nbsp;&nbsp;?) did not live in Blisworth for long as he
        followed employment with the railway companies.&nbsp; In 1891 he was
        recorded as visiting George and Elizabeth Hill (whose daughter he
        married) living in the Westley Buildings.&nbsp; Later he was recorded <font color="#000080" SIZE="3">in
        Greatworth (station master) and in Bradwell (signal-box manager).&nbsp;
        He retired to Northampton.</font>&nbsp; According
        to J.J. Green of Collingtree, his grandfather
        'Joe</font></font><font color="#000080">'</font><font SIZE="3"><font color="#000080">, practiced 'family'
        cobbling.&nbsp; Joseph George married in Blisworth a local woman, Polly
        Catherine Hill who was born in 1868 and died June 1925, buried in
        Blisworth.&nbsp; In 1909 they had a son Frederick Arthur Green.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">More notes in
        passing:&nbsp; <i>Polly Green's father George was a grocer and
        shoemaker.&nbsp; Her mother was also recorded in 1891 as a grocer so it
        appears they ran the grocer shop in the Westley Buildings at that time.&nbsp; Their
        son George William Hill (born c. 1846 in Stoke Goldington) became a cobbler
        after being an apprentice c. 1861 to Richard Green (junior) at 20 Stoke
        Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; In April 1895 he established a
        cobbling business in a modest barn shop on the High Street - see the
        photographs <a href="../cobblers.htm">here</a> and in the <a href="../Highsttwo.htm#hill">High
        Street section</a>.&nbsp; In
        1901, known as William Hill, he is recorded living at the Westley Buildings as a
        cobbler.&nbsp; &nbsp; By 1952 his barn
        shop (No. 13) was derelict and his widow, Mrs. L. E. Hill, lived next door at No. 11 High Street.</i></font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 15"><font color="#000080">Frederick Arthur Green
        (13 Dec 1909 - 28 Feb 1984) was born to Joseph George and
        Polly.&nbsp; There is no record of where he was born though the village
        of Greatworth seems very likely.&nbsp; He took up a career in engineering starting with an
        apprenticeship with LMS Railways at Rugby, later as an engineering
        fitter and toolmaker, finally as a foreman in Aero Controls Ltd. of
        Northampton.&nbsp; He retired to 37 Norton Crescent, Towcester.&nbsp; In
        about 1930 he married Nora Teresa Griffiths (born in 1908 in Shrewsbury,
        Shropshire) who was nursing in Creaton.&nbsp; Frederick and
        Nora's son John
        Joseph Green was born Aug 13, 1931 in Coventry.&nbsp; John Joseph also followed
        an engineering career which started with an electrical engineering
        apprenticeship with BTH, Rugby.&nbsp; After a spell with the RAF he
        joined the Post Office as a senior electrical engineer and rose to an
        executive planner in British Telecom.&nbsp; Having retired, John chairs
        the Conservation Trust in Collingtree and is a Church Warden for the
        church of St. Columba at Collingtree.&nbsp; We are fortunate to have bumped into him!</font>
