        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        location of the chief bakery in Blisworth has been somewhat varied -
        sites <b> I</b> through <b> IV</b> are described in the following.&nbsp; In around 1757 it was in the rear of the cottage now known
        as 38 High Street (site<b> II</b>) but before that it was evidently located in
        a house (site <b>I</b>) known more recently as Mrs. Huggett's Sweet shop.&nbsp;
        The table and map diagram below show these two places which carried
        Grafton Survey numbering of 14 and 10.&nbsp; The table owes its format
        to the careful transcription work of Mrs. S. Blake of Grafton Regis.

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Both
      houses were in the tenancy of Charles Good in 1757 but records clearly
      show that the 38 High Street bakery was run by a John Staughton or John
      Stalton (the spelling is uncertain) up to nearly 1757.&nbsp; There is no record of the
      earlier baker, perhaps of the 17th century, at the house near the Royal
      Oak but on this website are images of its demolition and there is quite <a href="../../TheCross.htm#flue">an extensive
      flue</a> at the rear of the house.&nbsp; There is a little more information on John Staughton in S.
      Dyster's account, on this website, of the Blisworth Baptist movement (the
      textual reference <a href="../../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm#Stalton">is here</a>
      and more is to be found at footnote #1 of that document).&nbsp; The
      current occupiers at 38 High Street moved in in the early 1960s to find a
      roofless <a href="../../High-Street/highst-detail.htm"> tumbled down barn</a> at the back which had been used as a store room for
      community trestle tables and chairs.&nbsp; There was no oven equipment
      found there at all.&nbsp;
      The barn was demolished to make room for an extension and garden
      landscaping.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We
      can now fast forward to the <a href="../../Blisworth&#32;Mill/millers-fire.htm"> mill fire in Stoke Road</a> in 1879.&nbsp; The
      mill was run by Joseph Westley and by his parents before him.&nbsp; It is
      reasonable to expect both milling and baking at the same premises at least
      since about 1838 so this is premises number <b>III</b>.&nbsp; The fire
      caused the loss of the mill but apparently not the bakery and Joseph
      Westley set up <a href="../../mills-blisworth.htm"> a
      better mill by the canalside</a>.&nbsp; Baking continued at Stoke Rd. by
      the Westleys until the death of Joseph prompted the family to quit in
      1895.&nbsp; The mill was then taken over by a local co-operative and the
      Stoke Road
      property was occupied by the Sturgess family who were the new village
      bakers.&nbsp; They probably used
      the ovens that were already installed there.&nbsp; In the first section of
      the <i> personalities pages</i> is a picture of baker <a href="../../People.htm#sturgess">Sturgess senior and his
      son</a> and the next picture shows Sturgess senior with his delivery van.&nbsp;
      Sturgess junior was born at the Stoke Road premises in 1901 and started
      work when he reached 13.&nbsp; They delivered bread to the surrounding
      villages using a horse and cart but obtained a Ford van in 1919 which is
      supposed to be the van shown in the picture.&nbsp; Prior to that purchase
      it was often necessary in winter to borrow a stronger horse to get through
      the snow and even get the blacksmith to add screw-in studs to the horse's
      shoes for a better grip in the snow.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">Some
      of the details of life before WWI was gleaned from a newspaper article
      written in 1977 after interviewing Sturgess junior.&nbsp; He recalled June
      22 1911 as it was his tenth birthday as well as King George V Coronation
      Day.&nbsp; The whole village went to the <a href="../../Blisgardens.htm">Blisworth
      Hotel gardens</a> and were
      transported there, if necessary, by Westley's wagons.&nbsp; There were
      regular Summer outings too.&nbsp; This entailed taking a railway trip to
      the seaside as the rail companies virtually &quot;invented&quot; the
      seaside holiday and did much to promote them.&nbsp; There is no record of
      where were the popular spots accessible from Blisworth.&nbsp; In those
      days the roads were very quiet allowing pastimes such as whipping a
      spinning top down the centre of the road.&nbsp; A record was established
      in continuous-whipping all the way to Milton Malsor which was impressive
      considering all the tufts of grass growing in the road.&nbsp;</font></span>
      <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">Every Sunday
      it was a village custom to bring joints of meat to the bakery for cooking,
      the reason being that cottage ovens were too small.&nbsp; Sadly, the sight
      of people marching through the village with steaming pots of dinner ended
      around 1935 when <a href="../../Highstone.htm#gas"> gas was laid on in the village</a> and the first gas stoves
      were available.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">There
      is a hint that the Sturgesses were tenants to the Westleys at the Stoke
      Road premises, rather than possessing freehold, for they were induced to
      depart, the site being taken over by a new firm, the <a href="../../baconfactory.htm">British
      Bacon Company</a>.&nbsp; The Sturgess business moved to a location in the
      High Street, in 1922; that is site <b>IV</b>.&nbsp; In those times a 4lb.
      loaf would cost 3½d or about 1½p - and that's for an enormous loaf by
      modern standards.&nbsp; The Sturgesses established their business
      in the High Street in a brick
      built extension added to the rear of a stone rear extension to what had
      become a double cottage unit.&nbsp; The brick extension is shown in the
      next picture* below.&nbsp; They also offered for sale some well known makes of
      bread as evidenced by the <a href="../../Highstone.htm#hovis">large
      &quot;HOVIS&quot; sign</a> attached to their house for many years.&nbsp; It
      might have been thought that the oven in the first picture was the one in use at the old
      mill site in Stoke Road.&nbsp; However it is definitely the oven
      at the house in the High Street and it seems very likely that Sturgess had
      a new oven installed there.</span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Those cast iron
      braces on the wall are the termination for four steel rods which hold the
      brick extension together despite the push from within that is the result
      of a shallowly domed oven roof.&nbsp; The oven appears to have an inside
      floor area of eight foot square.&nbsp; The view in the next picture
      clearly shows features exactly as they appear in the picture of father and
      son, referred to previously.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The 1920s contractors, Kemp &amp;
        Sons, probably specified the building and then installed their own
        casting as braces on the outside.&nbsp; Their three addresses in Stepney
        Green, E&nbsp; London, including Lupton House, were sites of a small
        oven manufacturing business which was established in the 1850s by John
        Kemp and which survived until the 1960s.&nbsp; The site of &quot;Kemp's
        Yard&quot; was cleared in 1968 to make room for flats.&nbsp; This was
        reported in the Enfield Archaeological Society records.&nbsp; It would
        be interesting to known whet<font size="3">her this oven, which must now
    be taken out to make room for the new occupiers' lounge, has famous sister
        ovens elsewhere in the Empire!&nbsp; <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">There
        is a Kemp oven still in the wall outside the old bakery shop in Banham,
        Norfolk, and one on display in the Rye Museum.&nbsp; Since loading and
    unloading the oven was via the only hatch door at the front, it is thought
    that the oven was heated using trays of burning coke which were periodically
    replaced with trays of tinned-up dough.</span></font></font>
