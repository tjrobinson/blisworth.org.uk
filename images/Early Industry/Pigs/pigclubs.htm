        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Our
        language includes the compound verb <i>to club together</i> to refer to
        the combined effort of a group of people with a common aim that is
        necessary because the commitment or effort of only one independent&nbsp;
        individual would be insufficient.&nbsp; &quot;Pig Clubs&quot; came into
        being in WWII years and continued for a few years as long as there was a
        severe rationing of meat.&nbsp; The government made it known that the
        setting up of pig clubs was to be encouraged by local councils.&nbsp;
        Farmers with an unused sty or a small and easily enclosed patch of land
        were encouraged to join a club and make that their contribution.&nbsp;
        At the same time, in the UK, there was another scheme which caught on in
        a big way - it was called &quot;Dig for Victory&quot; and led to parks
        and private gardens being set out for vegetable growing rather than
        flowers or lawn.&nbsp; Household economies benefited from the vegetables
        produced and our island was less subject to the stress from isolation
        should the German shipping blockade become more severe.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We
        do not have any <u>direct evidence</u> of a war years pig club in Blisworth.&nbsp; Hearsay
        claims that the two pig stys behind the <a href="../../Stokerd01.htm#butcher"> &quot;Butcher's shop&quot; in the Stoke Road</a>
        were used by a club.&nbsp; Below is a picture of the twin sty and a part
        of an early map (1838) to which has been added the outline of the little
        building thought to have been established around 1885.</span></font></p>

        <font color="#000080">The sty building is drawn in
        blue.&nbsp; It has a section at higher level that was probably a store
        and, during the war (1943), seemed to be used as a &quot;digs&quot; for a guy
        who called himself &quot;Posty&quot;.&nbsp; Enquiries led to only one
        suggestion: that Posty was <a href="../../ch-groups.htm#eddy">Eddy
        Bennett</a> who lived for many years with the Whitlocks across the other
        side of the Stoke Road.&nbsp; The floors of the stys are
        sloped in the standard manner but configured in an unsophisticated way
        so that a small man would have to go in to do any mucking out.&nbsp; The
        pigs would have been fed out in the open.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The model for a pig club is to purchase a
        piglet (or even breed piglets), fatten it using as much kitchen waste
        such as potato peelings as possible then slaughter the grown pig and
        have the meat distributed among club members.&nbsp; An important element
        of the pig-food preparation was to cook the waste vegetables in some
        'copper' to kill bacteria and prevent the pig from contracting various
        intestinal diseases.&nbsp; The boiled material, generally called <i>slops</i>
        was balanced in terms of nutrients by the addition of coarse flour (<i>meal</i>)
        and a small amount of salt.&nbsp; Despite food rationing, clubs were
        allowed to buy, legally, a certain amount of good pigfood to compensate
        for the meagre diet and some of the largest pig clubs in the country
        were encouraged to use professional slaughterers and sell some carcasses
        back to the government - this was rare however.&nbsp; Naturally there were clubs with
        particular resources, and some idiosyncrasies, where special ingredients
        were added to promote fast growth.&nbsp; The beer dredges from barrels
        from the local pub was a common supplement.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><a name="club"></a>By the early 1950s the
        government was forced to apply a brake.&nbsp; There were too many cases
        of pig diseases, some thought transferable to humans, that arose from
        the use of slops and eventually a law was passed that ruled against <i>any</i>
        use of domestic kitchen waste being fed to animals for public meat
        production.&nbsp; All pig clubs quickly died out.&nbsp; It came to light
        in investigating the accounts of the Blisworth's Allotments Association
        that there <i>was</i> once a pig club and in 1961 there were three
        residual members who wished to transfer £13 of unused funds into the
        allotments association.&nbsp; Names involved included Messrs. Stewart,
        Douglas and Sturgess.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack Stewart kept pigs &quot;all his
        life&quot; - at first with his father <a href="../../Personalities/GStewart.htm">Joseph</a>
        then at the sties behind the Royal Oak public house in
        the 1920s and finally on a patch of land next tothe <a href="../../baconfactory.htm#clifton">Clifton
        Cottages</a>.&nbsp; For some time he was a <a href="../../baconfactory.htm#stewart">slaughter-man</a>
        at the Bacon Factory.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">From
        the 1920s Blisworth was already well versed in all aspects of the pork business.&nbsp;
        Quite a few villagers worked at the premises of&nbsp; the <a href="../../baconfactory.htm"> British Bacon
        Company</a> - a <a href="../../Bacon&#32;Factory/Northside.htm"> collection of buildings</a> known as the &quot;Bacon
        Factory&quot;.&nbsp; The objective of the business was to provide
        wholesale pork and retail pies and other products.&nbsp; Another factor
        in favour of meat production know-how in Blisworth was Knut Erichsen's arrival, with
        family from Denmark, in 1947.&nbsp; They lived at Blisworth House and
        quite quickly Erichsen bought up the Asplin's farm land with the stated
        aim of breeding a fine white long-backed pig.&nbsp; However he actually confined
        his breeding to 8 acres of land near the canal and managed to sell a
        sizeable package of land for <a href="../../Common/housing.htm"> housing development</a> that saw Blisworth in
        the 1960s and 70s expand at an unprecedented rate.&nbsp; But to get back
        to pig clubs, they were probably more of a natural component of Blisworth life in
        the depression years until they were formally encouraged during
        WWII.&nbsp; An anecdote from the depression is that William Whitlock's
        pig was the thinnest in the village - he fed it sparrows that he managed
        to catch.&nbsp; Statements in Parliament around 1946 refer to the great success of the
        scheme as 4800 known clubs had been formed across the country.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>
