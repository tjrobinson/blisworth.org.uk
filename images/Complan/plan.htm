        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        village is generally thought to display much apathy since past discussions upon community affairs
        have been difficult to get
        going.&nbsp; Neighbouring villages have enjoyed varying success with a
        village plan, or a community plan, in response to urging from the local
        government.&nbsp; They have pointed out that it will be worth doing
        because parish council and <b>SNC</b> are obliged to listen and expected
        to take action in the simpler of issues.
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        village has been approaching <i>The Plan</i> this year (2009) in three
        stages, a village awareness day &quot;Blisworth Past and Present&quot;</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
        staged in the village hall on September 5th by the Heritage Society, a
        &quot;Come and Have Your Say&quot; Day also in the village hall on two
        days (October 10th and 11th) and, a few weeks later, there will be the
        circulation of a large questionnaire to all households from which some
        quantification could be obtained for the relative importance of
        issues.&nbsp; An important aspect of the plan is that it sets the scene
        for community management for five years - leaving some of us hoping the
        parish council can adapt to the challenge.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>The
        September meeting</b> emphasised village history and the role of various
        societies and provided an early warning and justification for the
        October sessions.&nbsp; </span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">It
        was reasonably well attended.</font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><br>
        </span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p><img border="0" src="sept-gather.jpg" width="780" height="355"></font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The October meeting</b> was
        particularly well prepared in that all households were given a leaflet
        about the meeting a few days prior.&nbsp; In the village hall the
        preparations involved the setting up of seven displays. These were on <b>1.</b>
        housing development,<b> 2.</b> general amenities, <b> 3.</b> sport and leisure,
        <b> 4.</b>
        youth facilities, <b> 5.</b> canal partnership projects, <b> 6.</b> the environment
        including conservation and <b> 7.</b> traffic and transport issues.&nbsp; The
        array in the hall was too difficult to photograph 'in one' - hence the suggestive
        composite which follows.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="comp-display.jpg" width="780" height="400"><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The
        displays
        were aimed to draw attention to specific issues and invite comment - most
        of the issues were in a context of 'let's improve the village'.&nbsp;
        Comments from all quarters were collected as 'Post-It' notes which were
        either put on display or placed in an anonymous box.&nbsp; Some displays
        were designed so that ticks may be placed into a choice of boxes.&nbsp;
        In one way or another, views were sampled.&nbsp; For every arrival at
        the hall, the
        location of their house was logged using red dots on a map of the
        parish.&nbsp; This revealed total numbers of households represented and
        in which streets they were distributed and here are the results of that
        breakdown.<br>
        </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <img border="0" src="callers.jpg" width="358" height="306"><br>
        <font color="#000080">It is clear that some parts of the village show a
        clear reluctance to take a look at the issues and perhaps we should look
        carefully at reasons why that is.&nbsp; One is obvious; people who
        live a distance from the centre do not consider the village as part of
        their life and so their responses were near zero, but perhaps surprisingly
        the area that was once 100% council housing returned only 5% and
        Ladyfield returned zero.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Nevertheless, a participation rate of
        over 20% for half the streets is at least a mildly encouraging outcome
        and, if a similar response is obtained for the questionnaires, we will
        be able to assume the results were a useful indication of village
        opinion.&nbsp; The neighbouring village of Roade received a return rate
        of over 40% for their questionnaires.</font></center><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">At the end of the two day
        session the comments were sorted so that issues could be graded in
        respect of their importance to villagers.&nbsp; There were put up 100s of
      &quot;Post-It&quot; notes which go forward in an analysis that helped
      design questions to be included in the questionnaire which was distributed
      to 800 households early in 2010 (not all houses could be sampled).</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>The
        Return of the Survey Questionnaires</b>&nbsp; By
      March 2010, the return of the questionnaire at Blisworth amounted to 75% -
      a truly amazing figure especially in view of the fact that <b>SNC</b>
      distributed in November 2009 an opinion questionnaire that overlapped the
      subject matter of ours!&nbsp; Slivers of
        statistical snippets have been disclosed occasionally, eg. in the
        Chronicle &amp; Echo and at the monthly Parish Council meetings.&nbsp;
        Further reporting on the topics will await the availability of a <i>complete</i>
        report which is expected on October 17th at a gathering in the Village
        Hall.&nbsp; The project has in the meantime been renamed <b>Community
        Action Plan</b> on account of the fact that actions have already taken place as
        a result of some of the findings in the survey, for example: the PC are
        responding favourably to the criticism about poor communications and
        that planning matters have been sometimes dealt with in a dilatory way,
        traffic surveys and speed-monitor vans are deployed (though <b>NHW</b>
        were doing that anyway) and a few new leisure groups are being
        established during the summer.<a name="detail"></a></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b><u>The
        Complete Report of the Survey</u></b> October 17th, 2010.&nbsp; Jan and
        Alan Andrews were responsible for setting up this project in the first
        place and Jane Percival has helped with useful input at times.&nbsp;
        Aside from these people, the main task was taken on by, in alphabetical
        order, Beryl Andrews, Di Burgoyne, Margarete Field, Mason and Pat
        Masterman, Ann North, Linda Pusey and Sarah Sykes.&nbsp; Along with the
        release of a limited quantity of survey documents that were filled with
        over 50 bar charts - just the bare results - there were a number of
        display boards with reproductions of many bar charts coupled with text
        that either explained them or pointed out some of the more obvious
        conclusions.&nbsp; Towards the end of the year there will be published the group's <b>Community Management Plan, </b>the
        &quot;<b>CMP</b>&quot;, that will set out suggested improvements for the
        next five years.&nbsp; The <b>CMP</b> will be sent to the parish
        council, the <b>SNC</b> and the <b>NCC</b> for discussion and an <b>Executive
        Summary</b> will be posted to all parish households - possibly with the
        Round and About magazine.&nbsp; Since writing this account, the
        publication date for the <b>CMP</b> was revised for January 2011 and
        then postponed again till end-April (&quot;Easter&quot;), 2011 - a total
        elapsed time after acquisition of some of the data (October 2009) of 19 months:
        Why?</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Clearly
        it is the <b>CMP</b> that we need to look at - or at least its Executive
        Summary.&nbsp; In the meantime here <a href="survey&#32;pointers.htm"> are some conclusions</a> drawn from
        a careful examination of the survey data - it will be interesting to see
        how much more penetrative the final plan proves to be.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">&quot;<b>CMP</b>&quot;
        is subject to a moratorium; terminology has reared its head in February
        2011 - it is thought inappropriate to describe the output from the group
        who is working on the survey as a &quot;community plan&quot;.&nbsp; It
        is to be named the &quot;Parish Plan&quot; instead.&nbsp; Arising from
        the survey and the parish plan, when we can read it, may be an action to
        generate a &quot;Village Design Statement&quot; (<b>VDS</b>), being a
        document that expresses the future desirable &quot;state&quot; of the
        village, against which future planning applications may be judged.&nbsp;
        So we need to get on, as a community, and write that <b>VDS</b>.&nbsp;
        The <b>PC</b>  had adopted a 12 month cycle for the development of this document
        having, in March 2011, received the draft of a very
        short-and-sweet version.&nbsp; Apparently as there is little development
        wanted for Blisworth, little space is needed to say so.&nbsp; By October
        2011 however, the details of the Localism Bill passing through
        Parliament had changed the goal posts rather dramatically - it is a
        Neighbourhood Plan that we must now attend to.&nbsp; This is covered in <a href="../New&#32;Houses/nhoodplans.htm">a
        separate article</a> first posted on this site in November 2011. </font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">The
        Parish Plan was distributed in early April 2011 and, without fear of
        exaggeration, it appears to be a very weak document and hardly a plan at
        all. It is <b>not</b> a plan though <b>it is</b> labelled addressing the
        period 2011 - 2016.&nbsp; However the latest scheduled attainment was
        for 2013 and merely dealt with an aspect of how the <b> PC</b> could better
        communicate with the village.&nbsp; Most &quot;actions&quot;, that were
        implied to be the result of the survey (though one must question that), were
        reported to be <i>ongoing</i> - until done, presumably.&nbsp; All of
        that is of course good news for the health of the village -
        self-improvement is ongoing.&nbsp; But otherwise, what a waste of
        effort.&nbsp; The reader's attention is drawn to the link two paragraphs
        earlier.</font>
