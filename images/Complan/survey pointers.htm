        2010.&nbsp; They <a href="Results2010.pdf">can be downloaded here</a>.&nbsp;
        In this article, each of the significant bars in all the bar
        charts have been converted into a positive &quot;pointer statement&quot;
        along with a reference to the question number from the original
        survey.&nbsp; The statements have been rendered totally positive (to
        emphasise their existence within the results) and they have been re-ordered and
        combined logically, where
        appropriate.&nbsp; This ordered list could be the starting point of a
        Community Plan - it will be interesting to see what is eventually
        published.</o:p>
