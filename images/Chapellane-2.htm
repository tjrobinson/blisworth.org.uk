      View towards the farm house at the bottom of Little Lane (see images <b>09-17</b>
      to <b>09-22</b> in part I).&nbsp; Villagers attempted to get a judge to
      overturn the district councils decision to demolish this house and three
      others in this vicinity.&nbsp; The bid failed.&nbsp; The problem was that
      the houses were owned by the council who took them unsold from the Grafton
      Estate.&nbsp; They placed families in the houses until they could no
      longer do that once the rulings on provision of sewers were laid out in c
      1933 by central government.&nbsp; The occupants had to be re-housed and,
      to avoid any 'business' that the council couldn't easily deal with, they
      simply ordered demolition.
