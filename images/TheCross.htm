        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;

      <td width="530" height="294"><a name="common"></a>There has been, since WWII, much heat
        dissipated in the village concerning the probability of &quot;The
        Cross&quot; being common land.&nbsp; Most of the village was owned by
        the Duke of Grafton up to the time of the Estate sale in 1919.&nbsp;
        Plot (56), comprising of 3 cottages including a blacksmith premises, was
        sold en-block.&nbsp; The map indicates with brown ink that the extent of
        the purchase would have been right across the Cross.&nbsp; Nowhere else
        on the village sale map is there an example like this.&nbsp; The brewery
        which acquired the Royal Oak (160) also, later, acquired five cottages
        comprising of the original plots (55) and (56).&nbsp; In consequence
        they have taken the line that what was possibly 'common' is their land
        and maybe used as a car- park for patrons of the pub.<br>
        Much argument arose in the 1960's when a seemingly obstreperous&nbsp;
        landlord shut the car-park to villagers including access to the side of
        a cottage in plot (57) thus attempting exclusivity.&nbsp; The parish
        council were central in considering the issues and &quot;after a long
        examination of various letters&quot; conceded that it would be a long
        legal battle to show that the Duke's ink was misplaced.&nbsp; I imagine
        that would be a battle that only the NCC could afford or perhaps be
        motivated to wage.&nbsp; The issue seemed to resolve itself into both
        sides saying there would be no further aggressive moves as long as the
        land would have associated with it a &quot;public right of access&quot;.</td>

        taken from a 1890 OS map, to an accuracy of about +/-1 metre (<a href="The-Cross/mapping/cross-common.pdf">see
        pdf report</a>).&nbsp; It
        is a trivial slice of land really and it is embarrassing how heated
        some discussions have become in dealing with it.</td>

        <p><b>32-06</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In roughly the
        place where the three cars are in the picture above there was a double
        cottage which housed the sweet shop belonging to Mrs Huggett.&nbsp; The
        cottages to the left are the same ones as in <b>32-03</b> above.&nbsp;
        The wide pavement, ie. The Cross, is now part of the car park for the Royal
        Oak.&nbsp; The camera is outside Young's shop (village general store)
        and the substantial wall to the right is the side of a long building
        which housed a mail sorting office before WW II.&nbsp; A better view of
        the sorting office is in <b>32-04 </b>and the record of its demolition
        is shown in <b> 32-11</b>, the rear wall being used as the boundary wall
        to the wider pavement.</p>
        <p>Date probably pre-1899 as no sign-post can be seen.<a name="flue"></a></p>

        side wall of the old mail-sorting room, also notable in picture 32-04
        above, which was demolished to provide
        a pavement from the crossroads to Young's shop.&nbsp; The date of this
        picture is Autumn 1959.</p>
        <p>It also shows the chain around the car-park which so inflamed
        villagers.&nbsp; The timbers over the Royal Oak clearly indicate that the time of the picture was not
        long after the thatch fire at the Royal Oak, say, winter 1959/60.</p>
