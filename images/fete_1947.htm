The video of the 1947/8 Fete</font></b></p>
<p>Little information is available on the fete held in 1947.&nbsp; Indeed, some
people have remarked that is more likely to have occurred in the year 1948,
going by the ages of some folk.</p>
<p>From the
video it can be seen that a group assembled outside the school and formed a procession down the High Street,
then going up the drive to the (old)
Rectory and then enjoys games and dancing on the lawn behind
the Rectory.&nbsp; We have at last discovered who made this film with
the kind help of June Danvers.&nbsp; It was filmed by Dr Steven Clements,
shortly after he began his GP practice for Roade and Blisworth, in
either May or late June.&nbsp; It was probably a May Festival and one of the
girls would have been the 'May Queen'.</p>
<p>
Dr. Clements filmed the sequences on a prewar Pathe onto 95 film and,
in roughly 1995, used a camcorder to transfer it to a Super 8 format.&nbsp; The
sequences were then fed to a VHS recorder whilst Dr Clements added a
few words to a sound track.&nbsp; He presented it to the village,
giving his name and some of the transcription details, in June 2005 when the
village was celebrating the Bicentenary of the completion of Blisworth
Tunnel.</p>
<p>We have had pleasure already in recognising a number of people
from that time.&nbsp; Unfortunately Dr. Clements can recall only a handful of
the
villagers' names.&nbsp; Whilst in the charge of the Heritage Society, it is
believed that a few minutes of recording at the end was excised, perhaps accidentally.</p>
