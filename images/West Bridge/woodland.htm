        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">This
        note relates some of the history and recent troubles over a triangular sliver
        of land alongside the GU canal just south of Mill Bridge on the
        opposite side of the canal from the towpath. In the <a href="../BlisworthMill.htm#1914 photo"> Blisworth Mill
        section</a> of images is shown a 1914 picture of the mill and the bridge
        with the sliver of land to the left. It is about 40 yards wide by the
        bridge and tapers to near zero-width about 150 yards to the south where a field
        (known historically as The Park) begins.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        sliver was once the Blisworth Public Wharf and was used for storing peoples'
        deliveries of wood, slates and timber. At the formation of British
        Waterways in 1948 the wharf became their property but later, when BW sought to
        develop it for housing, the Willow House family bought it from them, thus
        enlarging the garden around their house (location - see below). They
        were able to purchase all the wharf land immediately against the edge of the
        canal with an apparently confusing legal arrangement for access to the bank with BW
        (now the Canal and Rivers Trust).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        area was allowed to become overgrown at times but in 1970 it was cleared
        to allow renewal of the canal edge palling. Sometime in the 1990s some
        of the land was sold in order that a second house could be built (Heligan
        House) adjacent to Willow House. A complicating feature of the area was
        that a foot path had become established which ran from the south through The Park and
        along a line to emerge at the Towcester Road. This path gave some
        indication of the limits of curtilage around the two houses but ran with 'garden',
        defined technically, on both of its sides. The path is totally obscured
        from view in the next photo, taken
        in 2005, because a rough growth of mainly ash trees had sprung up more or
        less everywhere. This photo appears as 06-14, for comparison, in the
        Blisworth Mill section beneath the 1914 photo mentioned in the first
        paragraph (photo 06-13).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080"><img border="0" src="mill-2006.JPG" width="500" height="311"></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Shortly after the 2005 photo
        was taken the residents of Heligan House removed most trees and
        established a screen based mainly on laurel and have maintained the
        area well ever since, being some 70 yards out of a total 150 yard long sliver. In fact,
        Heligan House is well setback and the screen provides a rural feel
        to the vicinity of the bridge.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The other 80 yards run of
        the land was neglected and allowed to become well wooded and this afforded charm to
        the run of the pathway that became increasingly attractive for ramblers,
        casual walkers and dog walkers especially at times when there were no
        frisky bullocks in The Park. The next pair of photos gives an impression
        of what effectively became &quot;woodland&quot; - both taken by Richard Henessy, the aerial
        shot in March 2000 and the other in the winter of 2012/2013. Note that
        in the latter, Heligan House is visible beyond the laurel screen.&nbsp;
        The gate for the path to communicate with The Park is just visible at the
        bottom of the aerial photo.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>September 2013 to 23rd December 2013.</b>&nbsp; This was the period set for
        local consultation over the plan to place into conservation the margins
        (including certain historical features) of the <b> GU</b> canal for its entire
        run through Northamptonshire. The next picture is based on a <b> SNC</b> map
        showing Mill Bridge (bridge no. 51) with the proposed conservation
        limits lined out with a red line. For the 150 yards of canal margin/gardens
        that are mentioned above, between the bridge and the marker<b> P</b>, the red line fairly well
        follows the line of&nbsp; the walked pathway, implying a will in the
        conservation plan to manage well that part of gardens between the path and the canal
        and also, probably, the path itself. The line also divides fairly well between
        the house curtilages and the remaining garden areas, for both houses.&nbsp; The latter
        should amount to
        pleasant screening with some measure of management assumed. However, in
        the Spring of 2014, the policy for dealing with the 'offside' margins of
        the canal was changed (see below).</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080"><img border="0" src="clear&#32;fell&#32;area,&#32;Dec2013.jpg" width="463" height="464"></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080"><b>18th&nbsp; December
        2013&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;
        The resident of Willow House arranged to have the area of garden nearest
        to the canal clear-felled. No person other than the felling-contractors was
        involved in
        this action, this statement being necessary because <i>initially</i> it was rumoured that there had been a
        mix-up but later,
        the resident, by declaring publicly in a parish council meeting on
        13th January that &quot;one has a right to fell one's own trees&quot;, confirmed that the action was deliberate and not the
        product of a mix-up.&nbsp; The area that was treated that way is ringed with a yellow line.
        Villagers were then faced with
        a bare flat area adjacent to the canal rather than a short stretch of
        woodland path - that being something of a shock. The timing of the action to
        fell trees was within the conservation consultancy period and so the felling seemed very much like a <i>dash
        before the finalisation</i> of a conservation plan that would have been
        inconvenient to the resident. Many people wondered whether the resident,
        being a Parish Councillor, had violated the <b>PC</b> Code of Conduct.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080"><b>6th. January
        2014</b>&nbsp; At
        a parish council meeting, in which the resident was asked (being a
        councillor) to leave the room, a planning grant that had been
        deliberated over for perhaps the last 9 months was discussed in detail,
        sometimes heatedly. The crazy issue was that the same resident had
        succeeded in receiving full planning permission for a large house to be
        located at an adjacent point, shown by <b>H</b> in the last figure. The
        permission (recorded as S/2012/1057) prescribed conditions regarding the
        need for an arboreal screen both between the new house and the legally
        established pathway and further screening between the pathway and the
        edge of the canal. But that screening was to rely on a number of
        established trees to be retained for a period while the screen was
        expected to grow and become effective.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">The official position of the <b>SNC</b>
        (expressed later by R. Fallon, Development Manager) was then that the
        planning grant was no longer legally implementable but that the resident
        acted legally in felling the trees. What to do about the planning grant
        was the subject of meeting(s) between the resident and the planning
        enforcement officers. The village must simply await
        the planning decision which could well require a new application.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">The main point is that,
        although no one has done anything illegal, it is unfortunate that a
        village-wide appreciation of a little bit of woodland has been trumped
        by some selfish desire After all, the area possessed no trees early in
        the 20C and rather few in 1970. That is 40 years ago but that is long
        enough for many to forget and this is demonstrated in the 2010 Village
        Design Statement (prepared by <b>SNC</b>) in which the trees were
        classed as &quot;important&quot;.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080"><b>3rd February</b>&nbsp; At
        a parish council meeting there were two interesting agenda items. One
        was to lodge a formal complaint against the resident, as a parish
        councillor, and the other was to suggest a way in which an improved
        basis could be established for that area proposed as conservation area
        (between the marker <b>P</b> in the last figure and the bridge). That
        way would be to compulsorily purchase the area and have the <b>PC</b>
        and the Canal Partnership as managers.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">The first agenda item was set
        aside with no discussion with the comment that the topic was up to the <b>SNC</b>
        to deal with. Discussion on the second was heavily mangled and fizzled
        out with no useful resolution but this is a common occurrence in
        meetings of the <b>PC</b>. If the proposal had been read out and if the councillor (aka.
        the resident) had been asked to leave the room then perhaps the benefits
        of carrying out the proposal could have been considered. The proposal
        was to
        designate the strip of land adjacent to the canal a public area for use of walkers and boaters and develop it towards a
        wooded leisure area managed by some combination of the <b>PC</b> and the
        Canal Partnership.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">One sad aspect of the village,
        however, is that the proposal contains its own seeds of destruction in that few can see how the <b>PC</b>
        and the progressive Canal Partnership could ever work together.&nbsp;Besides that,
        the proposal drew support from no-one and in a subsequent <b>PC</b>
        meeting it was declared inappropriate as the area was in private
        ownership and was &quot;covered&quot; in the conservation measures.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080"><b>June 2014</b>&nbsp; By now
        it is possible to update on a variety of issues, namely (a) the un-implementable planning
        consent? <b> That remains so.</b>
        (b). the legally walked line of the pathway,
        presently obliterated? <b> The status of the pathway remains.</b> (c). the final outline of the canal bank
        conservation? <b> There has been a change to the policy, we are told; </b> a one metre margin has been introduced
        for <u> all</u> offside areas beside the canal unless there is a distinct
        <i>
        and relevant</i> boundary or outline to which the conservation should abut
        (an inset map to be added). So the
        thoughts from the <b> PC</b> in the previous paragraph were wrong and &quot;the
        resident&quot; need not have felled any trees, an action which happened
        to neutralise the planning grant . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a time for
        many adverse comments to be exchanged amongst villagers.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 7; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        future of this strip of land is by no means determined and readers
        should expect updates. In fact, on <b>Dec 3rd, 2014</b>, the outline of the
        conservation was redefined as along the edge of the canal and extending
        in width up to the pathway so that over the area in which tree-felling was
        done about half of the area is now within conservation. North of that area
        the conservation line follows the red line in the mapping shown above.
        This is a pleasing result as a sensible screen between the canal and any
        housing development should be easy to secure, that is if someone wanted
        to take care of the area.</font></p>
