<font color="#000080">VILLAGE 'WEST-END' MAP</font></font></b></p>
<p style="padding-right: 130"><font color="#000080">An interesting map has been
found in the book <i> &quot;The Military on English Waterways 1798-1844&quot;,
Compton &amp; Carr-Gomm</i>, drawn
by 'RJD'.&nbsp; The book documents the movement of militia on the waterways and
details the function of <a href="../Canaltwo.htm#barracks"> Weedon Barracks</a>.&nbsp; The map is reproduced, presently
without permission, in the hope that someone can elucidate on the <u> original
source</u> of the mapping.&nbsp; One or two errors have been corrected since the map
claims to represent the area in 1809 but some inconsistencies remain, viz: the
name of the inn 'Sun, Moon and Seven Stars' should be 'Half Moon Inn' at that
time; Richard Dent's Mill is now correctly positioned and should be in a disused
state since water was unavailable for milling from about 1795; both the rectory
and the Sun, Moon .. Inn are mis-drawn.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="padding-right: 130"><font color="#000080">The map possibly relates to
an original source of the following information:<br>
1.&nbsp; existence of a small building near and to the south of bridge 50.<br>
2.&nbsp; that the field so outlined nearby was a brickyard. (1938 information
mentions Brick Kiln Field for a much larger area.)<br>
3.&nbsp; that the nearest wharf to bridge 51 was Pickford's or, at least,
originally Pickford's (by 1805 the firm was supposed to have de-camped to Blisworth
Arm since their specialty was trans-shipments to/from the canal - they were
sub-tenants* of Barnes &amp; Roper Co.)<br>
4.&nbsp; that the company Barnes &amp; Roper Co. divided their yards so.&nbsp; (That they ceased to be partners
in about 1804 is documented.)<br>
5.&nbsp; the Pickford's warehouse appears to be drawn consistent with the 1838
map on this website but the 1812 Award map shows the warehouse nearer to the
bridge.<br>
6.&nbsp; that the wharf supervisor's house was so positioned close to the south
end of bridge 51 as early as 1809.&nbsp; It does not appear on the 1812 Award
map.&nbsp; (On RJD's original drawing the house was labelled a 'Legger's
Hut'.&nbsp; But it was not until about 1825 that legging boats through the
tunnel had been adopted.)</font></p>
