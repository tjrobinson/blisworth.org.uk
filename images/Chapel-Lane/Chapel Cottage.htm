        <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri"><font color="#000080">The
        property now known as Chapel Cottage is featured on an early hand drawn
        map dated 1727 and appears to include 4 separate dwellings (shown pink
        in the inset). This is some
        considerable time before the Chapel was built in 1827 and when Chapel
        Lane was called Mill Lane in the census of 1841. Little Lane was a very
        narrow way leading to the High street and all the other stone houses in the
        locality have long since gone. I am pleased to report that The Royal Oak
        was in existence at the same time! It would appear then that Chapel
        Cottage, featured on a map of 1727, might have been constructed in the
        1600’s?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of Blisworth came under the control of The Duke of
        Grafton. The 1727 map is in fact a survey map to help manage rents
        collected by the Duke.&nbsp; These four dwellings were evidently let to
        tenant 17, who was probably one of the leading farmers at the time
        (records are incomplete). In the 1838 survey map (next inset) they are drawn
        hatched-in to signify not being a source of rent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Furthermore, the cottages are excluded from some other Grafton maps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In fact, John Goodridge who had been a leading Baptist in
        Blisworth since about 1780 bought the entire plot of land, named
        “Little Ease”, from the Duke at some time before 1826 with the
        intention of building a Baptist Chapel.&nbsp; Before that time worship
        was done in a barn, <a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm">&quot;grudgingly
        allowed&quot; by landowners and Anglicans in the area</a>.<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p><img src="1838.jpg" height="204" width="206" align="left">
        <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri"><font color="#000080">Records of the occupants
        in the cottages do not start until the dates of the first
        Census in 1841. A separate map from roughly the same time, 1838 see
        inset, shows
        the cottages looking like 2 dwellings but we know from old photographs
        and the Census documents that there were at least 3 dwellings and
        probably 4. The first Census, in which individual houses often cannot be
        identified, does not reveal any ministers of a religious faith.&nbsp;
        However Henry Marriott, a tailor, was one of <a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm#first">the
        first dozen</a> or so Baptists and is recorded living in Mill
        Lane.&nbsp; Most inhabitants were agricultural workers with wives as lace makers,
        there was also a platelayer
        and a plasterer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears
        that where Trisha and I now live no less than 16/18 people were housed.
        By the census of 1851 and 25 years after the Baptist Chapel was built,
        we see the occupants broadening their employment. The cottages then appear to
        be numbered 44, 45, 46, &amp; 47 Chapel Lane. In 44 lived the Baptist
        minister Ruben Lucus, his wife and daughter. In 45 lived John Easter,
        Servant to the Duke of Grafton, his wife Elizabeth and three children,
        one at school, one a stone mason and one a lawyer. In 46 lived Francis
        Lambert an agricultural worker and his wife. In 47 there was Fredrick
        Lambert an agricultural worker, his wife and one daughter both lace
        makers and a son just 2 years old.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri"><font color="#000080">Moving on to 1861 the cottages appear to
        have addresses as 49 to 52 Chapel Yard and thankfully the occupants had
        dropped to 11. In 49 lived Joseph Marriott a tailor and shopkeeper with
        his wife a housekeeper. In 50 there was George C Bailey Baptist
        minister, his wife and Annie Lepper, a nurse and housemaid and in 51
        Richard Rockingham, a young miller’s assistant.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;<o:p></font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri">In
        1881 census the occupants are registered as in Chapel Hill? Whether this
        is a mistake or the Lane did change name for a while is unsure. By 1901
        there appears to be definitely just 3 dwellings 69,70 &amp; 71 but 71
        perhaps the smallest houses a family of 7. The earliest photographs seem
        to be about this date and show that the house nearer the Chapel was not
        rendered and the two thatched cottages nearer the road were painted
        white, also not rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        the period 1865 to 1871 the Chapel was enlarged and there must have been
        a demolition of one dwelling unit, at the end furthest from the road, to
        make some room.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri">In
        1911 the house nearer the Chapel is called “The Grey House” and
        accommodated the Amos family. It would seem that locals customarily
        called the two thatched cottages “The White House”. By 1920 the
        cottage nearest to the road was shortened to make way for an upgrading
        of the road. It is likely that this would have left the remaining
        thatched section uninhabitable and so was demolished and replaced by the
        part under a lower roof line now housing a garage with 2 rooms above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>At this time the structure would have become one residence.</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p></o:p>
        </span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">There
        are six photographs of the cottage(s) available in the <a href="../Chapellane.htm">Chapel
        Lane section</a> of the Images Collection.&nbsp; Listed in sequence of
        oldest first, there are the following images, all with a 09- prefix: 08,
        04, 05a, 06, 19 and 07.&nbsp; </span></font><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri"><font color="#000080">Between
        the 1920’s and the 1960’s the whole cottage was cement rendered,
        probably to cover the multitude of change made over the years, and
        painted white. Other than regular changes of inhabitants it would appear
        that little structural change took place in those years. One interesting
        fact is the alignment of the floors in relation to the building. It
        shows even now evidence of the slight angle between the two parts of the
        overall building as shown in the 1838 map, inset above.</font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri"><font color="#000080">The
        cottage was completely modernised internally in 2005. Further
        modernising was done and an extension was added in 2010 to
        enhance the north elevation and increase space within, see the title
        photograph. <o:p>
