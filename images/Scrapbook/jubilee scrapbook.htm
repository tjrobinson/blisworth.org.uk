        In 1953 there was a County-wide competition, between parishes, for the best
        scrapbook generated about village life and history. George Freeston <a href="../Articles/Blisworth's-Archives.html">won
        this contest pretty easily</a> with his 90 page submission. He used his
        own 'copperplate' style and glued in 100s of copies of photographs that
        he had collected, dedicating pages to streets, activities, industries,
        the Canal, the Church</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
        and village characters, both present day and historical, etc. In fact, the
        beginnings of this website in terms of design owed much to the
        scrapbook. There is available a file (see <a href="../indexhistorical.htm">historical
        index</a>) which presents the pages in relative miniature and there is a
        CD, on sale from the Heritage Society, on which all the pages can be
        displayed at full size on an IBM PC (ie. none-Mac computer).</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        The
        1953 &quot;Elizabeth II Coronation Scrapbook&quot; is presently cared for by the
        Blisworth Heritage Society and in
        honour of the Queen's Jubilee in 2012 it was decided that the Society
        would invite pages for a <i> new</i> scrapbook, a &quot;Queen's Jubilee
        Scrapbook&quot;, to serve as
        a modern record of the village. Whilst the 1953 scrapbook was based on
        an old 'Empire' paper size, roughly A2, it was considered best to opt
        for A3 as the new standard page size. At the beginning of the year it
        was explained that each page should be the product of one person or
        group and the nature of the material &quot;could be anything&quot; - any
        personal or group subject, any historical or present day aspect.&nbsp;
        It was thought that 6 months should see the job of collecting the pages
        completed but it actually took nearly the whole year. Accordingly, on
        November 30th 2012, for two days, the pages (bar one or two...) were on
        show in the Village Hall before they were grouped for binding.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The 2012 scrapbook will also
        be available on a CD.&nbsp; The pages will not be placed on this website
        because there is a copyright and permissions problem attached to such
        new and diverse material, this notwithstanding the fact that a few
        people, in generating their page, have derived material and images from this
        website, which is fair enough. There are a few exceptions to the above
        applying to subjects that are new and relevant to an archive and in
        those cases specific permission will be sought from the page authors.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The output has been impressive as there are over 150 pages and it is
        intended to append an index of the pages and authors to this article as
        soon as that is possible. On this subject; an important village project,
        it seems a shame that more cannot be made of it here - of course, it is
        the work of the individual
        contributors' that says it all. Some prizes were offered by the Society
        to those who generated the 'most impressive' pages within various
        classifications and that enhanced the Christmassy fun of the event.
        Winners are listed below. The photos which follow were taken in the Village Hall on December 1st
        2012 when all pages were laid out for inspection.</font></p>

      This has been a major project but the A3 printed and bound scrapbook has
      now been completed and has been available for inspection a few times -
      there are a total of 186 pages. About five full copies have been printed
      and it is hoped to launch later in the year a A4 version which will be for
      sale. In the meantime a number of villagers have thought to generate a
      page and as a result the page count will likely exceed 200 pages. A view
      of a feature of the cover, ie. some motifs from the recently completed
      tapestry kneeler covers,&nbsp; is shown below, along with a list of the sections in which the
