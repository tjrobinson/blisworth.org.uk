        the machine cycle below. Each ring of lining required two loads of
        material in and two of spoil out.&nbsp; No passing bay was needed and
        all personnel had to sit in the back of the trucks for safety. Walking
        to work was strictly forbidden as drivers simply backed down the dark 5m
        wide tunnel. And as the reline progressed timing of their lengthening
        journey became critical to progress. The ride became exhilarating.&nbsp;
        Machine excavation had started June 1983 as the Grosvenor shield kicked
        off from a hand enlarged chamber. Progress accelerated with double ten
        hour shifts, then hit the ten rings a shift target which had been
        planned and made Mowlem agent John Woods 'happy that we got the system
        right'. Segment<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>supply<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

        units needed to drain the network of old construction headings running
        at the foot of the sandstone beside the tunnel.&nbsp; Some had been
        expected from the survey. Others were uncovered as the lining was broken
        out and this gave just four hours warning from discovery to ring
        building.&nbsp; Segment packs had to be quickly reshuffled up at the
        surface to match. &quot;The yard gang get ten out of ten for that&quot;,

        both client and contractor, are that the smoothly running machines could
        not have been allowed to keep going to the south end of the bore. As it
        is the shield is now being stripped out to leave its skin in the ground.
        Local repairs and pointing will have to suffice for the comparatively
        sound remainder of the tunnel where British Waterways has to revert to
        its more familiar style of subsistence maintenance.</font></p>
