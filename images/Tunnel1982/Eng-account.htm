        <p><img src="rg.jpg" align="left" width="147" height="189"><font color="#000080" size="3">One
        of the highlights of my engineering career began when Tom Mann, BW’s
        Engineer Construction called me into his office and reminded me that
        some years previously I had worked for London Transport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Not unreasonably, he thought that I might have some experience of
        working on tunnels and it would be appropriate to take on the remedial
        works to Blisworth Tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        did not like to mention that I had mainly worked in the Bridges and
        Structures design office, but I soon became involved and learnt
        something of the history of Blisworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It was pointed out by Malcolm Stakes BW’s Mining Engineer that
        canal tunnels are the oldest tunnel structures in the UK, pre-dating the
        railways by 50 years, the major sewers of London by 80 years and the
        London tube tunnels by 100 years.<o:p>&nbsp; I
        attempted to research the design rules adopted at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But all I could find was a rule of thumb that the thickness of
        the tunnel lining in inches should equal the width of the tunnel in
        feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This corresponded
        with the tunnel lining thickness of 18 inches.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">Blisworth
        Tunnel had problems throughout its history, including during its
        construction which commenced in 1794.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There was at least one attempt at building the tunnel which had
        to be abandoned before finally completing the tunnel in 1805.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It has been suggested that <a href="../Tunnel&#32;Story/Tunnel-Story.htm"> there is evidence</a> of two abandoned
        sets of workings, but that debate has not yet been concluded.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        problems at Blisworth are related to the <a href="strata&#32;diagram.htm"> geology of Blisworth
        Hill</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Water bearing sandstone overlies lias clay and when the clay
        absorbs water it swells and develops forces strong enough to distort the
        tunnel lining.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus the numerous failures in the tunnel have resulted in the
        tunnel floor rising and have sometimes only become obvious when a boat
        crew has reported hitting something solid below water.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">In
        those days of working by hand, tunnels were constructed by sinking a
        series of construction shafts along the line of the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Excavation of the tunnel then proceeds from the bottom of the
        shafts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The setting out at
        Blisworth was clearly of a good standard as the tunnel “wriggles”
        somewhat but is reasonably straight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">Much
        of the tunnel was constructed along the interface between the sandstone
        and lias clay and to deal with the ground water problem an extensive
        network of drainage headings was constructed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We could speculate whether it would have led to a more successful
        (but longer) tunnel if there had been one less lock on the Stoke Bruerne
        flight and the tunnel driven at a lower level mainly in the clay.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">In
        considering the problems at Blisworth the tunnel was divided into three
        sections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The northern
        third from 0m – 950m is built largely in the clay and is in reasonable
        condition for its age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Problems
        are associated with construction shafts, which even when backfilled act
        as drains allowing the groundwater to flow down to the lias clay.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        geology of the southern third from 1875m – 2812m is not as simple as
        the northern third.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
        are even short lengths where the tunnel floor is unlined sandstone. But
        the tunnel lining should be adequate for many years of service given
        adequate routine maintenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
        on my last visit to Blisworth I did not see much evidence of routine
        maintenance.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        major problems were in the middle third and most of the past failures,
        including those that closed the tunnel in 1977 and 1979 were in this
        length and were associated with the clay/sandstone interface.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        1979 failure involved a serious bulge in the lining with consequent
        damage to the brickwork.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Temporary
        timber supports were put in, designed to permit a single narrow boat to
        pass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With two failures in
        two years it was considered that a detailed investigation should be
        undertaken before proceeding with another local repair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For a period boats were allowed through the tunnel with a BW
        crew, but the tunnel was then closed to all traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is not known how much the political impact of cutting the
        canal system in two affected this decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It was a time of serious under funding for BW and there were
        numerous engineering problems which could not be dealt with because of
        the lack of finance.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">While
        funding for major repairs was awaited, consideration was given to the
        various options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
        stage in the process was a detailed survey of the tunnel lining above
        water level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in
        mind that the majority of failures originated from the lower part of the
        tunnel, it is perhaps surprising that the tunnel was not dewatered at
        this stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The survey was
        carried out by dividing the internal lining of the tunnel into metre squares which were
        categorised according to the type and severity of deterioration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Other details such as previous repairs, openings to drainage
        headings and water inflows were also recorded on the survey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>At an earlier stage in the history of the tunnel it was decided
        to record the date of repairs with date bricks set into the new
        brickwork.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This practice
        was continued in the repairs from 1982 -1984.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">A
        summary of the more serious problems along the length of the tunnel
        illustrated graphically that the middle third was more seriously
        affected than the outer thirds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
        the results of boreholes were analysed and the different strata were
        identified, the geological reasons for the pattern of failures became
        clear.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">Consideration
        was given to various options for repair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But it had to be borne in mind that the tunnel lining had failed
        on numerous occasions in the past, the first failure within 20 years of
        the tunnel opening and it could be guaranteed that unless the structural
        problems were dealt with there would be further failures in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Thus proposals such as drilling and reinforcing the lining with
        chemical grout were not serious contenders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>A proposal to install a secondary lining within the tunnel was
        also rejected as it would have restricted the tunnel to one way traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Although an innovative solution and outside of B W’s experience
        a replacement of the brick lining over the middle third with a pre-cast<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>concrete lining was considered to be the best solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>At a later stage Mott, Hay and Anderson Ltd. were appointed as
        consulting engineers to supervise the site investigation, design the
        replacement tunnel and supervise the contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They appointed an extremely experienced tunnel specialist
        David Bridges as resident engineer.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">My
        first visit to the site was in 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Tom Mann and I had previously met with engineers at the Principal
        Engineer’s office in Gloucester.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There was a definite atmosphere at this meeting and obviously
        some resentment that the project had been given to the Construction
        Section at Rickmansworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
        were also advised that we would get little cooperation from the local
        management in the London Area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        had arranged with Stan Voyce the Northampton Section Inspector to take a
        boat through the tunnel to get an appreciation of the problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>As it happened I knew Stan from my involvement in Nalgo and on
        completion of our inspection we were invited back to his cottage in
        Blisworth where his wife Mary had prepared lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Tom and I reflected that cooperation might not be such a problem.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">On
        opening the steel gate at the South portal and emerging from the tunnel
        we were greeted by a photographer who I later realised to be George
        Freeston the local historian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
        he got to know that we were going through the tunnel I have no idea, but
        little went on through the construction period without George knowing
        about it and recording it for his archive of photographs<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We all got to know him well as a regular visitor to the site<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">In
        1981 it was agreed that the Government would make available a
        “Specific Grant” to BW to tackle the arrears of maintenance and £4.8m
        was allocated to Blisworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        catch was that a substantial amount of site investigation was needed
        before design work could proceed, followed by the actual remedial work
        and whilst no expenditure was permitted before April 1982, a substantial
        proportion of the grant had to be spent before April 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Tenders had been invited for a detailed site investigation and
        Geotechnical Engineering were on site early in April. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">For
        safety reasons it was essential to identify all of the shafts which were
        associated with the original construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We were aware of Wast Hill tunnel in the Birmingham Area where a
        fatal accident was due to part of the brick lining being removed leading
        to a collapse of the backfill in an unsuspected construction shaft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Some of the Blisworth shafts were backfilled and some left open
        but a brick dome or timber staging installed to seal the top of the
        shaft.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Open shafts were also required to provide ventilation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Including two new shafts which were provided for ventilation following an
        accident in 1861 involving a steam tug, there were a total of seven ventilation
        shafts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In total 21 shafts
        were identified, excluding suspected shafts associated with the initial
        unsuccessful attempts to build the tunnel which were sufficiently remote
        from the tunnel to not cause concern for safety.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">Boreholes
        were sunk in the surrounding ground to verify the rock strata and
        through the tunnel lining to confirm the quality of brickwork and the
        surrounding ground conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        tunnel was de-watered to enable an inspection of the invert and the
        drainage headings were explored.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 354.4pt" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">When
        the drilling through the tunnel lining was being carried out from a
        drilling rig on a boat we had a visit from the Factory Inspector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He was not impressed by the protective shield that had been
        installed to protect the drillers in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>the event of bricks being dislodged from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>the tunnel lining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However
        the Factory Inspector required that we have adequate protection to
        support a large section of brickwork falling on the boat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Delays due to the Health and Safety Executive we could do
        without, so I refrained from pointing out that such a collapse would
        sink the boat.<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">In
        order to commence the remedial work as early as possible, I proposed
        that we let a preliminary contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This contract was tendered and awarded to John Mowlem and
        included the installation of cofferdams, dewatering of the tunnel,
        constructing an access road to the North portal and through the tunnel
        to the starting point for the re-construction and installation of a site
        compound and offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus
        the main contractor, also John Mowlem as it turned out, would be able to
        make an immediate start following award of the contract.<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        main contract consisted of breaking out the old brick lining of the
        central 900 metres of the tunnel and constructing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>a new lining using pre-cast concrete segments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Allowance was made to connect to ventilation and construction
        shafts, drainage headings and areas of high water inflow, either by in
        situ concrete work or the provision of window segments in the pre-cast
        concrete lining.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        ground through which the tunnel passed had been disturbed during
        construction of the tunnel and drainage headings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Consequently a &quot;tunnel shield&quot; was specified that included a
        forepoling facility to support the ground immediately in front of the
        excavation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a further
        measure to bring forward expenditure and meet cash flow targets, the
        shield was pre-purchased by BW.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">Work
        on the main tunnel contract started in January 1983 by breaking out a
        section of tunnel lining at the start of the middle third to construct
        an enlargement of the tunnel in which the shield was assembled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Although the main tunnel drive was highly mechanised, the
        construction of the chamber for the shield relied heavily on the muscle of
        skilled miners and was an extraordinary piece of work.<o:p>

        </span>The shield provided protection to the workforce and support to
        the tunnel whilst the excavator mounted at the front and capable of
        rotating through 360<sup>o</sup> broke out the lining and surrounding
        ground to form a 6.5m diameter tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        0.75m.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cement / PFA grout
        was pumped in to fill the voids behind the concrete lining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        fender to keep boats away from the circular lining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Window segments were also installed to provide openings to
        drainage headings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
        vital that segments were loaded in the right order to ensure that they
        were delivered to the shield to form part of the correct ring in the

        enjoyed a slightly hair raising ride into the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The drive progressed so well that towards the end I spent a lot
        of my time arranging for visitors and in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>the last few days telephoning those who had expressed interest in

        one regret about this project was that on completion of the middle third
        we did not continue for a few metres more, where there was some
        brickwork that could have been replaced, or better still continue to the
        south portal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        few days before the opening of the tunnel on 22<sup>nd</sup> August 1984
        went by in a blur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can
        recall explaining to the staff of Clements Department Store in Watford
        why I needed two lengths of white ribbon about 6 metres long but forgot
        to buy a pair of scissors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        had let it be known to the IWA unofficially, some weeks before that I
        was confident that the tunnel would be open in time for boats to travel
        from the southern Grand Union to Hawkesbury Junction for the IWA
        national rally.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a queue of boats down the length of the Stoke
        Bruerne flight of locks and beyond waiting to go through the tunnel.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        evening before the tunnel opening was enjoyed mostly in the Boat Inn at
        Stoke Bruerne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had spent
        many lunchtimes there with David Bridges the resident engineer and other
        colleagues from the tunnel project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It was hard to believe that a manic two years was coming to an
        end and the project was nearing completion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But I was in no condition to return home for the night and be at
        the tunnel again in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately
        one of the many IWA members on their way to Hawkesbury invited me to
        stay on his boat.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        conclusion of a major engineering project can be an emotional event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>David Bridges and I shared the commentary on the two VIP boats
        which led the procession from Blisworth to Stoke Bruerne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But I was totally unprepared for the massive crowds at both ends
        of the tunnel and had to pause for a moment when the north portal came
        in sight and I realised just how many people had turned out to celebrate
        our achievement.<o:p>
