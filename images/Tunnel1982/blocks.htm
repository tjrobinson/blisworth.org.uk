        <p><font color="#000080">When the tunnel was first drained in 1982 for
        the repairs, which included the short stretches outside the tunnel
        portals, the derelict side walls, particularly on the West bank, north
        end, were seen to be in a bad condition. At the Blisworth end, large
        squared blocks of stone had fallen &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; into the mud.
        They had once formed the side wall at the tunnel approach. There were
        also some on the east tow path side. All were duly lifted on to the bank
        - as pictured.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">These displaced stones did not belong to the
        original canal construction. It is assumed that the original side walls
        were built up with limestone blocks from local quarries, which soon
        suffered from the bumping of the boats when mooring or when entering the
        tunnel — hence the larger blocks were later used to replace the early
        walling. But where did they originate?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">When R. Stephenson constructed his London to
        Birmingham railway he placed his rails, when passing through cuttings,
        on large stone sleepers (remember too that the 1800-1805 Blisworth Hill
        Railway had run on stone blocks). However, Stephenson's blocks soon
        became unsatisfactory owing to irregular settlement, so they were
        removed and replaced with wooden sleepers throughout the line. The
        redundant stone blocks, from this change, were put on the market for
        around eighteen pence each. It appears that the Grand Junction Canal Co
        purchased large quantities, for they can be found in many places along
        the canal length. This explains their presence at the tunnel entrance,
        allbeit in the water, and at the number 51 bridge hole at Blisworth.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">On pointing out their historic worth to the
        site engineer, he readily offered to make use of them again. But as the
        side walls were steel piled and topped with a concrete kerb the stone
        blocks were instead placed in a row along the bank, see <a href="../tunneltwo-1982.htm#blocks">photo
        in which some can be seen</a>, and behind the
        concrete. It took two hefty miners and a JCB to lift and place the
        stones. They were used as seats during the re-opening of the tunnel last
        August. It saddens me however to report that out of the eighteen blocks,
        only two remain: the others have seemingly been heaved back into the
        canal — no mean task, for they must have weighed up to 300 pounds each
        ... and children cannot move such weights.</font>
