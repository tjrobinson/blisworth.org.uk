        <p align="center">All pictures are presented at relatively low resolution.&nbsp;
        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        which a village pump is fixed, the two houses appear to be sharing their
        gable walls.&nbsp; Therefore it is not surprising they had to be
        demolished together.&nbsp; A new paper-shop and a police house were
        subsequently built in the gap created.</p>

        house near Church lane is the farm house and the next picture shows the
        right-hand high gable of that building.&nbsp; On the extreme left is the
        old school - as the village hall it looks much the same, from the front,
        as it did then but now has a new front door to the right of the porched
        door - please see <a href="schools.htm">Schools</a> section.
        <p>Behind the old school are some <a href="baconfactory.htm"> Bacon factory buildings</a> which were
        demolished in 1967.</p>
        <p>Between the old school and Home Farm there is a house and yard which is much the same now.&nbsp;
        There was an associated one acre paddock running as far back as the back lane (RD2 path)
        but it was used to accommodate Eastfield street and the Eastfield
        play-area.</p>
        <p>This picture is supposed to be taken in 1958.</p>
