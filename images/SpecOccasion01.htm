        <p align="center">All pictures are presented at relatively low resolution.&nbsp;
        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        carry tall staves which have wooden knobs on top.&nbsp; By tradition,
        such staves were used in country street dancing to whirl coloured
        ribbons etc.  
        <p align="left">George Freeston has referred to the club as the Penny
        Club - where parents pay the rector a penny (1d.) a week and this saved
        up to buy clothing for a needy child.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is likely anyway that
        a small number of such clubs co-existed in the village in addition to
        the custom of the Duke of Grafton providing a load of coal for the
        village in each Autumn.

        Primrose League</a>  disbanded as recently as 2004 - the link here takes
        you to their information website.&nbsp; The league was formed in 1883 and
        inspired by Disraeli.&nbsp; It strove for unity between the classes,
        promoted women's rights but deprecated the suffragette movement.&nbsp;
        By 1920, women far outnumbered men as members.&nbsp; Once the
        Conservative Party had established its regional and central offices, the
        league could see no future role.</p>
