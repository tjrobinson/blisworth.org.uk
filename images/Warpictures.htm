        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        second world wars, the British Military Authority issued to soldiers
        money vouchers.&nbsp; During active combat this was not done (as far as
        is known) but after &quot;The Liberation&quot; ie. when the soldiers were
        <u>
        occupying a foreign country</u> the issue was then made.&nbsp; The money was
        also known as 'Occupation Pay' and was only negotiable within a military
        enclave.&nbsp; If anyone knows the point of this please write in to
        explain.&nbsp; At demob the money was exchanged for real money.
        <p>Notes such as these are collectors pieces these days.&nbsp; These two
        were kept as souvenirs - the Austrian one, worth more like 2/- in those
        days and dated 1944, probably related to the German/Austrian occupation
        of Poland.&nbsp; No one has any idea how the Blisworth man, who brought
        these notes home, got hold of it.</td>

        This photo was taken c. 1952* and shows they still possessed their rifles
        and had formed a rifle club which practiced in a disused sandpit at
        Milton Malsor, taking in members also from Gayton and Tiffield.&nbsp;
        The cash residue of about £7 was divided between the Baptist and Church
        Sunday schools and the Evergreens.

        <p>* doubt has been recently expressed about this date and that ex-homeguard

        casualties&quot;.&nbsp; One other woman from Blisworth, a Miss E.
        Barrett, was recruited to B Company and in Northamptonshire there were
        nine other women recruited.
        <p>&quot;We had the main line station and the canal in our area and so I
        suppose, with our signalling, we were part of the defense system.&nbsp;
        We had to be able to recognise enemy aircraft and know the distinctive
        noise they made especially at night.&nbsp; On bombing run returns (eg.
        Coventry) the enemy would lighten their load by dropping bombs&quot;.
