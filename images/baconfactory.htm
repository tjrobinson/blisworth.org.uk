        one of two called Clifton Bungalows which were built for bacon factory
        employees in the 1920s or 1930s.&nbsp; They were at the bottom of the
        field now occupied by Windmill Ave and Wellspring with access from Back
        Lane and were demolished in 1969 by the developers.
        <p>In the front garden of one of them was the chestnut tree mentioned in
        <b>02-02.</b>&nbsp; At the time of the photograph it was occupied by Bob
        and Rita Oakley.&nbsp; He worked at the bacon factory and Rita worked in
        the wine bottling company set up in the mill building by the
        canal.&nbsp; Bob also worked at wine bottling for a while and worked at
        Dalgety's on the Northampton Road.<br>
        Perhaps the Oakley family hold the Blisworth record for house moving; 1958-62
        they were in the &quot;Westley narrow house&quot; (pictured in <b>02-05</b>
        and <b>02-06</b> below), from 1962 to 66 at Clifton Cottages, from 1966 to 69 in one
        of the two &quot;bacon factory cottages&quot; on Stoke Road (see <b>30-03</b>
        in Stoke Road section).&nbsp; After that they moved to a house in
        Connegar Leys and from there into a bungalow in Connegar Leys - making
        five houses in all.</p>

        Green, who kindly supplied the photograph.</td>

        are not in view.&nbsp; The date of this picture is therefore some time
        between about 1925 and 1938.&nbsp; Presumably the garden fence dips
        towards the rear of the houses because of the profile of the ironstone
        cutting created 1890 - 1910.
        <p>The far bungalow was called Clifton and the nearer one was called
        West View (Sylvia Cairns has recently corrected me)</p>
        <p>In some ways it would
        have been better to have left these houses and incorporated them into

        Joseph's grandson, also a Joseph, died having built up a baking and
        milling business which was crucial to the development of the
        village.&nbsp; Since then it was used residentially, particularly by
        employees of the Blisworth Bacon Company from 1925 until the early
        1960's by which time the company had moved its abattoir and meat
        processing to a site on the Northampton Road.
