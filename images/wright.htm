        <p align="center">The following sequence of seven pictures shows how the
        wheel is finished by adding a steel band called a &quot;tyre&quot; to
        hold the wheel together and provide a durable surface to contact the
        road - our
        present day pneumatic tyres are named after the steel band.&nbsp; The
        pictures were taken at Clipston c.1900 and the wheelwright is Frank Freeston - George's
        uncle.

        <p align="left">The central boss has been fitted with 12 spokes, in this
        case, and just six felloe pieces have been fitted to the outside end of
        the spokes; one felloe to two spokes.&nbsp; The neighbouring felloes in
        the round have been half-lap jointed.&nbsp; Much of the skill in being a
        wheelwright is obtaining a perfectly round wheel with all the spokes
        tightly fitted at both their ends.&nbsp; If he fails then the wheel may
        not stay perfectly round, be uncomfortable to ride on, and much weaker
        than it could be. </td>

        which could interfere with the fitting.
        <p>The band has been made too small to slip over the wheel so that only
        when it is very hot can it be fitted.</td>

        place, the tyre is quickly cooled with water.&nbsp; It then shrinks a
        little and becomes tensioned around the wheel so keeping all its
        components cramped together.
        <p>The stage is then set for the next wheel.</td>
