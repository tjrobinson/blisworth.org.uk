        <p align="left"><b>23-16&nbsp; </b>This group of pictures cover the Wild
        and Woolly races in Fisher Close, Blisworth.&nbsp; The course of the
        race crosses through Fisher Brook five times and <u>over</u> the
        culverted stream once.&nbsp; Various dates represented here.&nbsp; By
        2000 the field was not available and the race was then held in fields
        near to Blisworth Arm.&nbsp; Having no stream tended to discourage
        Blisworthians who had become used to expecting a
        muddy romp for over 50 years. 
        <p align="left">Events were promoted by the Northampton Motor Cycle
        Club, the earliest being in 1925.&nbsp; The original course was three
        miles and two laps for a race was enough!&nbsp; The character of the
        event was recognisable; cows were up to their stomachs in mud, cycles
        ceased as damp mud coated the magnetos, one cycle caught fire!&nbsp;
        Bill Freeston finished fourth and earned a bronze medal. 
        <p align="left">The event was not set on boxing day until 1929 and has
        been held then every year except the war years. 
        <p align="left">The 1988 programme, or rather part of it, can be <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/download.php?filename=Occasions/WWprog.pdf">downloaded
