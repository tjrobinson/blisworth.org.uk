        <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp; Once the bypass for the village was complete, the road
        through the village was &quot;detrunked&quot; from A43 status to
        something less than a B road.&nbsp; Politicians claimed the opening of
        the bypass would reduce traffic through the village by 90%.&nbsp;
        Richard Hennessy conducted a statistically significant traffic count of
        his own in 1993 and showed that the average daily vehicle count had
        dropped from around 14000 to an estimated 5000 to 6000.&nbsp; However,
        the quietness of the road through the village had encouraged speeding and by
        1993 traffic advisers came up with a plan.&nbsp; They would calm the
        traffic, not with sleeping policemen as residential properties were too
        near the road for that, but with growths added to the pavements to
        deliberately bottle-neck the flow.&nbsp; There were four places which
        were modified - the Towcester Road near to the 30mph speed-limit sign
        (with a chicane as seen in the picture to the left),
        the junction of the Towcester Road and the Gayton Road by the mill, the
        staggered cross roads at the Royal Oak and the meeting of ways at Elm
        Tree Corner.&nbsp; The chicane at the Towcester end of the village came as a
        potentially deadly
        shock to so many drivers that the Min. of Transport had to remove the
        measure within 6 months. </td>

        <p align="left">The effect of the traffic calming measures were not as
        much as the road engineers predicted.&nbsp; As indicated below, a
        significant improvement in vehicle speed is noted at Elm Tree corner, by
        the school.&nbsp; For traffic proceeding towards Towcester (but not the
        other way) their passage by the Royal Oak is much calmed.&nbsp;
        Elsewhere the benefits are marginal.<br>
        Richard Hennessy's statistics, taken on the Towcester Road, show a daily
        vehicle flow just before the calming of around 6400, with around 7%
        being heavy goods vehicles.&nbsp; Afterwards the count indicated 4800 in
        an average day with just the same proportion of heavy vehicles.&nbsp;
        The expected reduction arising from heavy vehicles preferring the bypass
        did not materialise.&nbsp; At the time of writing this account, January
        2006, the general view of villagers is that traffic has increased
        considerably since 1993 but perhaps no worse than anywhere else.&nbsp;
        The Stoke Road now carries a much increased flow at peak times.&nbsp; It
        is thought that this is because the Courteenhall Road T-junction with
        the A508 is no longer useful at peak times and the route through Stoke
        Bruerne has been adopted for vehicles heading for Roade Comprehensive
        School and Milton Keynes alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

        Note the old white line to be erased in the right-hand &quot;after&quot;
        photograph and the hand crafted sign to Towcester.&nbsp; It is fair to
        say that the new junction works well to slow traffic coming into and
        leaving the village.&nbsp; However, with later road signs for Blisworth
        either being too small or vandalised, drivers of heavy goods vehicles
        tend to think the way to Towcester involves bearing right.&nbsp; A kerb crunching
        multi-point turn has been crafted in front of Grafton House.</td>

        sensibly heeded and driven over at 20mph or is seen at the last minute and
        leads to an erratic swerve to continue a course for Northampton.&nbsp;
        Traffic setting off from the halt sign, having guessed at the intentions of oncoming
        traffic viz. &quot;straight on&quot; versus&nbsp; &quot;turning
        right&quot;, may violently swerve and mount the kerb
        on the right so taking the
        space from which this right-hand picture was taken.&nbsp; The signs now
        in use are smaller than those clearly visible in the left-hand picture -
        many drivers wanting Northampton head off towards Stoke Bruerne or just
        stop across the junction and shout, even get out, for confirmation.&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been no injuries here yet but a certain
        amount of red and white glass has been strewn on the surface!</td>

        right is for a bus stop.&nbsp; The substantial extension to the pavement
        on the left works well in slowing traffic leaving the village - those
        passing through at 40mph at last have to slow down there.&nbsp; Traffic
        turning towards Courteenhall, or coming from there, have a turn with
        adverse camber.&nbsp; We have seen a 15 ton trailer with grain
        overturned by a careless tractor driver.</td>
