        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;

        <p>This photograph is to explain the changes.&nbsp; The original
        photograph was taken in c. 1920 by Walter Alexander (see <a href="SpecOccasion01.htm">Occasions</a>
        page).&nbsp;&nbsp; In red is shown the
        new door and the window (1934).&nbsp; The pump P and the jetty-way J to the
        rear of the houses are shown.&nbsp; Mr. Pinfold, the coal merchant, used to daily take his horse
        through this jetty-way into the rear garden (not actually through his
        house as some have said).</p>
        <p>After demolition and rebuilding, the Alexander's property, now No.
        12, remained to the
        left of the green lines marked A and the new shop NS was built to the right of
        the other set of green lines.&nbsp; The new shop was set back to be in line with the front
        elevation of No 12.&nbsp; A new jetty-way was left between the old and
        new - in line with the 'new' door.</p>

        There was a time when the shop was set up in opposition to <a href="Shop.htm#young">Young's
        shop</a>, by the Newmans.&nbsp; A
        young shop-assistant at the time, Linda Burrows nee French (<a href="people-three.htm#french">Ron

        daughter) tells of what the shop was like;<br>
        &quot;The times I used to get shut in down in the cellar, getting
        stock.&nbsp; It wouldn't be allowed now, of course, as the cellar opened
        up into the shop.&nbsp; Bruce (Newman) used to shut it if a customer came in and
        I had to wait then - for him to remember I was down there to let me
        out.&quot;
        <p>This picture was taken whilst oil street lighting was still in use -
        pre-1928.&nbsp; At that time Mrs Huggett's sweet shop was the first door
        on the right.&nbsp; The sign above the door advertises &quot;Rowntree's
        Wine Gums&quot;.&nbsp; A little later, the shop was moved to the second
        door and the nearest house fell to near ruin and was used as a store
        until the demolition of four cottages on The Cross, including the shop,
        in c. 1950.</p>

        sides of the white gates) down the Stoke Road to the entrance to a yard
        which is still an access way today.&nbsp; Originally thatched, the roof
        was modified in a very unusual way to cater for the four dormer
        windows.&nbsp; The bay window was associated with a clothes shop as far
        back as 1900 and in one of the <a href="Stokerd01.htm">Stoke Road</a>

        company.</p>
        <p>The walls threatened with bulges and the row was demolished for

        Progressionists Society established this shop with its prominent brick
        wings.&nbsp; The society disbanded in 1870 and Walter Young, a farmer's
        son from Roade, moved in to set up a grocer's general store.&nbsp; There

        1871 to 1983 it was run by the Young family and still stands today as a
        general store with an extension built in 1984, on the left-hand end, to
        house the post office section.</p>
        <p>Early adverts by Walter Young are issued by a W J Young.&nbsp;
