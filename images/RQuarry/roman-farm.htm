        Roman Site near Blisworth ?</font></b></font>
        <p><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">In
        1840 a farmer unearthed some blocks of masonry on the Blisworth and
        Gayton&nbsp;parish boundary, a 100 yards north-east of the &quot;Gayton Road
        Crossroads&quot;.&nbsp; What was subsequently discovered was a Roman
        villa or temple with modest rather than exotic appointments as judged by
        details of the remnants.&nbsp; The villa was placed very near the
        highest point of Gayton Hill.&nbsp; A curious point is that there
        may have been <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#romans"> a straight-line track from the site of our parish church
        to that highest point</a>.&nbsp; Such track could have been Roman or
        Anglo-Saxon.&nbsp; In 1991 <a href="../Earthworks.htm#corn"> a Roman crop dryer</a> was found when the new A43 bypass
        was created.&nbsp; These points amounted to something of a Roman
        presence at Blisworth - that is, a quarter of a mile away on the parish
        boundary.&nbsp; Another probably site, that was never investigated, can
        be presumed at the Loundes where, in c1955, Mrs. Millar found some
        Samian ware pottery.</span></font></span>
        <p><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Now we have a site that is much closer to the village -
        but lets not get too excited, the purpose of this page is to simply
        record the facts.&nbsp;</span></font></span> <font size="3" color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Recently
        archaeologist Stephen Young, who organised the recent investigations <a href="../Archeology/gayton_dig.htm"> in
        Gayton</a> and Tiffield parishes, has made a brief on-foot survey of a site
        near to what was once Glebe Farm, long suspected of being of
        interest.&nbsp; The &quot;Google&quot;-based map below shows the area
        south of the Towcester Road and the public footpaths marked in
        green.&nbsp; These paths are mentioned at the outset as a way of pointing out that
        the central region of the map has <u>no right of access</u>.&nbsp; The area
        is traversed by the <a href="../Articles/Roman-Salt-Way.html"> Salt Way</a>, thought to exist in Roman times, which is
        supposed to link the old Pattishall Road that emerged from fields
        opposite the Pynus Cottages and track remnants, recorded on a 1727
        Grafton map, which made up a westerly extension of Knock Lane, crossing
        Nunn Lane.</span></font>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Incidentally</span></font><font size="3" color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">
        the area also features two very old quarries which are easily visible in
        terms of both soil colouration and cropmarks; a faint oval one to the
        east and a fan-shaped one in the centre. An old field which spanned the
        area was named &quot;Slatpitt Furlong&quot;, meaning an open pit for
        limestone slates used more recently in ridge-and-furrow cultivation in
        which the unit of land was termed the Furlong.&nbsp; Because of the
        established field name in 1727, we can assume that
        the quarries dated well prior to 1700.&nbsp; Anyway, the layout of the
        &quot;fan&quot; seems a wasteful approach compared to the 19th century
        manner of progressing laterally with a single gullet.&nbsp; The fan-shaped one appeared
        with striking clarity when Richard Hennessy sailed over in 2003 in an
        air-balloon, <a href="../aerialviews.htm#quarry"> the aerial view</a> he photographed is shown on this site.</span></font>

        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The on-foot
        investigation, July 2009, was carried out in the strip of land shown by
        the east-west blue mark.&nbsp; There was found about 20 pieces of Roman
        pottery, grey- and grog-ware indicating a long span of occupancy.&nbsp;
        The quantity was greater than could be explained from manure spreading
        (broken pots end up mixed with barn cleanings hence incorporated into a
        spread for fields) and therefore implies a settlement - probably a
        farmstead.&nbsp; There were no tessellation pieces which might have suggested
        a luxury accommodation.&nbsp; In moving south from that strip, some 20
        to 30 yards wide, it was
        noted there was nothing more was to be found and the conclusion is that the
        quarrying had destroyed traces if there were any.&nbsp; The site
        therefore lacks potential and is likely to have insufficient appeal for
        any geophysics survey which carries with it a significant cost.&nbsp;
        What a shame that is!&nbsp; The significance of the discovery is that a
        probable farm-stead has been found so close to the village.&nbsp; That
        the little valley occupied by the stream, just to the north and
        north-east of this place, could have been settled too seems inescapable
        - there was probably a Roman- Blisworth!&nbsp; The best place to look
        for evidence would be the bluff on which the church, the rectory and
        Blisworth House are placed.&nbsp; Perhaps that area should be designated
        of archeological interest, creating an alert whenever new housing or
        barn demolition is anticipated.&nbsp; Anywhere nearer to the line of the
        stream must have been already disturbed by the canal construction.</span></font>
        <p><img src="stony-tracksm.jpg" align="left" width="263" height="128"> <font color="#000080">Another brief survey was done in the
        north-south strip - not by the archaeologist.&nbsp; The reason for
        selecting the strip was the prominent soil colour difference in a narrow
        path extending north from a place alongside the &quot;apex&quot; of the
        fan-shaped quarry.&nbsp; The &quot;path&quot; is shown in the inset
        picture - it is very stony and relatively loamy compared to the sand or
        ironstone appearance of the field on either side of it.&nbsp; A couple of Roman pottery bits
        were found but the area was mainly strewn with post-medieval (17th to
        19th century) pottery and glass and some bits of old brick and farmer's
        drains.&nbsp; At the top of the area, an aerial survey photograph from
        1951 shows a small farm barn.&nbsp; The impression gained was that the
        &quot;path&quot; was once the access route to the quarry combined with a groove in
        the ground that was once eroded by a spring and by winter-water from the bed of the
        quarry.&nbsp; The spring continues into the field below, being The Park
        Slopes, and flows throughout the year, following the red line in the map
        above.&nbsp; It is named in c1820 as &quot;Ramwell&quot;.&nbsp; The line
        of the spring could well have been an afternoon &quot;resort&quot; for
        villagers to enjoy the view.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b><a name="undulations"></a>The Fan-Shaped Quarry Area</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A panoramic photograph taken, looking south,
        from the apex of the fan quarry is shown below.&nbsp; The panorama is
        nearly 180º wide but, in the picture here, the span has been compressed laterally by factor x4 to accentuate
        the field undulations that are present across the area.</font><br>
        <img border="0" src="quarry4x.jpg" width="800" height="233"><br>
        <font color="#000080">The colours have not been given much extra
        contrast and the sky was completely overcast.&nbsp; The colour mottling
        is purely because of variations in limestone fragment density in different
        places.&nbsp; Note that the hedge line also undulates since the quarry
        once extended further south into the next field.&nbsp; The fall-off in
        level to the left is towards the stony &quot;path&quot; mentioned in the
        previous paragraph.&nbsp; The reason for the quarry, considering its
        level, is for limestone (slates, as mentioned before) but we cannot
        discount a possible interest also in ironstone as (a) a source of
        building blocks centuries ago or when (b) pioneer miners came
        to Blisworth after 1851 when they actually <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm#turnpike">began in the field</a>
        behind the camera adjacent to Towcester
        Road.&nbsp; Because the fan-form undulations prominently remain, it seems very
        doubtful that much ironstone was removed from here, post 1851.&nbsp;
        Note that the limestone would have practically outcropped at this
        location, which is slightly domed, whereas ironstone lies beneath
        limestone.</font></p>
