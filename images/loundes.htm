        <p align="left">&nbsp; Richard Dunkley became a well known architect and builder in
        Northamptonshire and later in London.&nbsp; He built the <a href="Arch.htm">Railway
        Arch</a> in c. 1835 and tended to build public houses such as schools
        and chapels.&nbsp; Located in Station Road next door to the <a href="BliswHotel.htm">Blisworth
        Hotel</a> (currently called The Walnut Tree) it was given its name from
        the name of the field on which the hotel stands - Northward Lowne or
        Nether Lowne also known at about the same time as Lownds.</p>
        <p align="left">Incidently, Dunkley also built the hotel for Thomas Shaw
        in about 1844.&nbsp; The owners of the hotel in the following years made
        use of the rest of Nether Lowne for <a href="Blisgardens.htm">ornamental
        gardens</a> - later still for a swimming pool known as Blisworth
        Lido.&nbsp; The aerial picture below indicates the location of the
        house, looking north.&nbsp; The large field to the west was Nether Lowne
        and at the time of the picture, c 1960, the gardens and pool had given
        way to a 'mobile home' park which has since about 1975 adopted permanent
        pre-fab type housing. </td>

        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a pronounced glacial melt-water groove
        crossing both fields which ensures that the fields are well drained.&nbsp; A large pond, surrounded by mature trees, is situated
        across the middle of Nether Lowne.&nbsp; Until a culvert was installed,
        c. 1975, under the homes park there were irritating flash floods there.</p>

      <td width="1223" height="271">In this picture the barn that was known as
        Loundes barn is shown before it was demolished in the 1980s.&nbsp; It
        was frequently painted by artist Peter Newcombe.&nbsp; In the aerial
        shot above it can be seen against the road on the left, two thirds up
        the picture.&nbsp; It lay in Gayton Parish but it got its name,
        presumably, because a strip of fields on the Gayton side of the parish
        were also called the Loundes for a while.
        <p>The history of the two Lowne fields are as follows.&nbsp; In the 1729
        survey map they are absent and presumably not cultivated. By 1757 they
        are both let to Wm. Plowman.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1812 inclosure award
        map, below, they are both shown at the limit of the inclosure by that
        time.&nbsp; Either common land or waste land extended towards where the
        railway and the canal were to be routed.&nbsp; By 1838, Nether Lowne had
        become overgrown, presumably, as the Grafton records show it is &quot;in
        hand&quot; - by then called &quot;Lownd&quot;.&nbsp; A sizeable patch of
        heavily overgrown land was therefore sold to Thomas Shaw.</td>

      <td width="1223" height="319">There is a good reason why the fields were
        not easily manageable - especially the lower field.&nbsp; They are based
        on clay with a tendency to loose top soil due to their slope.&nbsp;
        Being sheltered they are liable to collect windblown weed seeds and any
        that are suited to the clay will flourish.&nbsp; The name &quot;lound&quot; or &quot;lowne&quot; means a grove in old
        English, a dell in modern terms which would readily become overgrown.
        <p>The &quot;E&quot; in this map, also superimposed onto the aerial
        picture, is placed at the end of an access track (no longer present to
        its full origin extent)
        joining the Gayton-Blisworth road .&nbsp; With common land to the north
        and east, this track would be the only sensible one for a Blisworth
        farmer to use.</p>
        <p>So why would there be so much interest in just a couple of
        fields.&nbsp; The answer to that is shown on the next map from the
        &quot;Monuments Records Office&quot; which indicates a cluster of animal
        enclosures etc. probably of pre-historic origin.&nbsp; The position on
        the hill coincides with where ironstone would be near the surface.<a name="cropmarks"></a></td>

        crop marks in the 1950s</a>, is shaded in green and the same area is <i>also
        shaded in green on the aerial picture</i>.
        <p>&nbsp;The dotted line is the Gayton parish boundary.</p>
        <p>It is significant, I think, that the area of the cropmarks runs into
        that of the
        two Lowne fields.&nbsp; The
        idea that this was a place of pre-historic settlement, especially in the
        discrete lower field is very
        plausible.&nbsp; It could have had significance in the Saxon era
        also.&nbsp; The size of the domain of Blisworth (ie. Blidesworde) by 1068, as indicated in
        the Domesday survey, seems quite small compared to the current parish
        and it is likely the area was regarded as waste - it might not have been
        seen!&nbsp; Gayton is not even recorded in the survey.</td>

        shown in pale yellow the extent of ironstone extraction, 1860 to
        1905.&nbsp; This is clearly wrong as no indications of prehistoric
        activity would be seen from the air on
        disturbed land.&nbsp; It is also noteworthy
        that the clusters of finds (of objects of antiquity) indicated on the
        map to the west relate to the Roman Villa that was originally discovered in
        1840.&nbsp; That area was of course obliterated by the ironstone works.<br>
        It is noteworthy that in Mona Clinch's time the features were <a href="Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm#pits">recognised
        as pits in which animal bones were to be found</a>.&nbsp; Hence the
        features are evidence of a settlement nearby.&nbsp; The underlying
