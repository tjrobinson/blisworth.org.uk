        picture which predates the installation of the organ in 1888 - indeed,
        the dating of this picture may well be c.1860.&nbsp; Note
        that the chancel floor carries some display and the walls are carrying
        'Stars of David' which suggest it was Christmas when the picture was
        taken.&nbsp; George Freeston has pointed out that the decorations could
        have been influenced by village artist, poet, songwriter and
        calligraphic marvel, John Green (1843-1918) - <a href="Church/JGreen&#32;Work.jpg">judge
        for yourself</a>.&nbsp; Note other points; there are no oil lamps, there are staves at each 4th pew
        in which are mounted candles and the panels of the pulpit are painted as is the beam at
        the head of the rood screen. The reredos behind the altar appears to be
        draped, consistent with the fact that the intricate carved reredos was
        installed by the Elmhirst family as late as 1910. </p>

      <td width="1670" height="233" colspan="2"><font SIZE="3">When the
        historian John Bridges visited Blisworth Church during the late
        eighteenth century, he recorded a series of memorial floor grave slabs
        within the Church, to members of an ancient Blisworth family named
        PLOWMAN (or PLOUGHMAN prior to 1700). In 1871 and as a grand finale to
        an extensive restoration programme, the floors of the Church aisles were
        raised and covered with the then fashionable encaustic tiles made by
        Minton, Hollins &amp; Co. of Stoke-on-Trent: the former Plowman stone
        either being covered or destroyed? However, out of necessity, the pews
        and floor tiles have recently been removed from the south aisle and at
        least one complete Plowman tablet has been found, together with a broken
        section. The complete tablet was as recorded by Bridges and is worthy of
        a re-recording:
        <p>&quot;HERE LIETH THE BODY of Mrs. Elizabeth Plowman late wife of Mr.
        Rich'rd Plowman Senior who was buried Oct the 24 1700 and in the 77th
        year of her age&quot;</p>
        <p>Many of the cut letters are in-filled with the original black
        bitumen. The complete tablet has now been raised up to the level of the
        new concrete floor which will ultimately be carpeted. The organ has also
        been dismantled and removed from the chancel, where it stood against the
        north wall: this has revealed the stone frame and blocked up recess of a
        north door, sometimes called a 'priests door' . The organ is repostioned at the west end of the
        church.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
