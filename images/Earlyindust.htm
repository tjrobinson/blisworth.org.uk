        <p align="left">There is very little recorded on house building.&nbsp;
        However a notable point about Blisworth is the polychrome stone banding
        using in building the majority of 18th century houses.&nbsp; A rather
        tidy form of the design continued in more recent construction.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>11-01</b>&nbsp; The main reason for the design shown
        in this image is that both the locally available stones have
        disadvantages as a material - the limestone is rather too soft and
        therefore too weak and the ironstone, especially any blocks with high
        iron ore content, cannot be sawn.</p>
        <p align="left">Blisworth is not the only Northamptonshire village to
        display polychrome banding.</p>

        <p><b>11-02 </b>The disused limestone quarry in c. 1950.&nbsp; It has
        now been land-filled - it was located half a mile behind the &quot;Blisworth
        Stone Works&quot; on the Stoke Road (see <a href="Stokerd02.htm#stone">
        image <b>30-20</b></a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; The quarry was probably in operation as
        early as 1800.&nbsp; Its production was certainly significant between
        1821 and 1914.&nbsp; It was closed in 1921 when the Hunsbury iron
        furnaces near Northampton closed down because of operational
        difficulties after WWI.&nbsp; Most of the stone was sent down a
        wagon track to a canal wharf at the <a href="Ironstonebr.htm">Ironstone Bridge</a>
        (see image <b>17-02</b>).&nbsp; From there it was shipped by canal to
        Blisworth Arm and thence to the iron furnaces wharf and thence to
        Hunsbury where it was used as a flux.&nbsp; One difficulty the
        iron company experienced was a severe shortage of towing
        horses for the narrow boats after the war.<p>&nbsp;</td>

        The tall house to the extreme right is Westley's house which was used by
        the bacon factory after 1924.&nbsp; Westleys closed down the baking side
        to their business when Joseph Westley jnr. died in 1895.&nbsp; It was
        then transferred to Thomas Sturgess (see <a href="People.htm">Personalities</a>
        section for both Westley and Sturgess).&nbsp; The son William Sturgess continued and, by 1924 when the
        land was sold to the British Bacon Company, he had set up a bake house on
        land next to Jasmine Cottage on the High Street.</p>

        and the arrival of both canal and railway called for thousands of bricks
        to be made locally.&nbsp; This and the next photograph are believed to
        have been taken at Asplin's brickyard which was located near to
        Blisworth Arm (actually in Gayton Parish).&nbsp; The yard remained in
        operation until the 1930's and was a significant source of employment
        for villagers.
        <p>&quot;Impromptu&quot; brickworks were set up on Blisworth Hill to
        convert some of the clay from the tunnel digging into bricks for the
        tunnel lining.&nbsp; These have been removed but occasionally a floor of
        bricks and burnt brick rubbish has been found by farmers.
        <p>George Freeston has pointed out that many men/boys seem to have
        make-believe fags in their mouths.
