      <td width="256" height="71">The Grand Junction Canal, including the tunnel
        through Blisworth Hill to Stoke Bruerne, was completed in 1805.&nbsp;
        The map below, from Grafton's survey in 1838, shows the south-western
        part of Blisworth including the mouth of the tunnel.&nbsp; In the
        process of achieving alignments the chief engineer of the project, James
        Barnes, had set the level of the canal in Blisworth at about 90 metres
        above sea-level (there are no locks in Blisworth).&nbsp; He also
        presumably positioned the canal a sufficient distance from the twin
        cottages (6 &amp; 7), which once faced onto a green, so that the slope of the ground in the cutting for the canal would
        not exceed 20º.&nbsp; As the road previously passed roughly over
        the position of the tunnel mouth, he must have rebuilt the road to be
        close to the cottages.&nbsp; Indeed it appears that he was constrained in
        that the canal could not have been placed any further towards the east
        because of the cottages.&nbsp; Modern Ordnance Survey bench-marking
        places the road at a height of 106 metres near location (A)
        and, by survey about 107 metres at location (B).&nbsp; Simple calculation
        using the scale for the survey map reveals that the average slope angle
        for the cutting in both locations was about 17º and these results
        are shown on the map.&nbsp; This calculation relates to the water
        surface, road surface and the edges.&nbsp; Given a 6 foot towpath higher
        than the water and a grass margin of 8 foot to the roadside, the average
        soil slope would have been 0.2º larger.&nbsp; Thus Barnes ensured
        that he abided by his own design rule.&nbsp; It is noted in the company
        minutes, c. 1800, that Barnes energetically resisted increasing the rule to 30º in order to save digging out so much soil, rock and clay in the
        vicinity of the tunnel mouth.&nbsp; There are <a href="canal_cutting.htm#archives"> archive
        pictures</a>, taken
        1890 to 1940, that appear to confirm a reasonably uniform slope.<p>The map also shows land ownership for 1838; the areas tinted pink
        were
        Duke of Grafton land, otherwise the area belonged to the original canal
        company, GJCCo.&nbsp; At the sale of the majority of the Grafton Estate in
        1919, for reasons of death-duty, there is no record of how much of the
        slopes area was acquired by the GJCCo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 For example, did
        the Parish or County Council insist on acquiring a strip of land
        adjacent to the Stoke Road in order to fulfill the general requirements
        of maintaining the road, whatever requirements were thought appropriate
        for that purpose in 1919?&nbsp; It is beyond the scope of this paper to
        comment on County Council land-holding in the period 1919 to 2000 but,
        regarding the Parish Council, there were requests sent to the GJCCo., to
        <a href="../../Canal/millner.htm">T.W.Millner</a> in fact, from 1907 to
        1919 to repair the fence by the Stoke Road, with the implication that
        the GJCCo. &quot;owned&quot; the land and trees up to the road well before the
        estate sale.&nbsp; This correspondence warrants a detailed examination
        from the &quot;GJCCo. side&quot;&nbsp;and attempts are being made to do this.&nbsp; In the N.R.O. there is an
        assortment of letters both to and from Millner and it is clear that the
        County Surveyor also wrote to him about the state of the fence.&nbsp; In
        the earliest Parish Council letter of 1905 it was pointed out that
        &quot;the <a href="Chester.jpg">bank was giving way as well</a>&quot;.&nbsp;
        In 1915 Millner received a reply to his letter from his boss instructing
        him to continue patching the fence and when the war is over &quot;we
        will consider some ferro-concrete fencing&quot;.&nbsp; Ownership of land
        and fence seems implicit.&nbsp; Incidently, the boat stable shown may
        also be visible in an early <a href="../../Canalone.htm#tug">picture of
        sailing on the canal</a>.

      A steep fall in the land adjacent to the road verge is of concern in case
      a vehicle should leave the road.&nbsp; A strong 'Armco' type barrier seems
      appropriate and it would be a good idea for road engineers to apply safety
      measures to this sometimes busy road just as they do in other places.

        Today there is a variably wide plateau in the soil of the slopes to the
        east of the canal and this is noticeable for 100s of feet running
        north/south in the vicinity of both locations (A) and (B).&nbsp; The
        possession of an elementary optical level gauge has allowed assembly
        of a representative profile for the slope and this is shown in
        the diagram to the left, being <u> very much</u> an estimate.&nbsp; At both ends of the soil profile the
        slope exceeds 45º and it is obvious that the road could be being destabilised by such a profile.&nbsp; </td>

    <tr>
      <td width="856" height="70" colspan="2"><a name="clayetc"></a>On entering the area by path from
        the south end, the first impression is that the land has slumped down
        maybe 3 metres&nbsp; near the road.&nbsp; Could
        it also have slumped towards the canal (and be washed towards it by the
        weather) and be lost from the site in the form of dredged out mud?&nbsp;
        Could it have been excavated and used elsewhere?&nbsp; Perhaps no-one
        has been watching this area over the years so a precise answer cannot
        be given.&nbsp; However, there is gained a very definite
        impression, particularly from the roadside, that much soil or clay has been lost over the years.&nbsp;
        At one location there is a pile of
        moss-covered blue clay (marked 'C' in the map, 5 to 10 tonnes), evidently pushed together by a vehicle, which
        suggests that one reason for alteration to the slopes profile might have been
        in moving and/or in removing clay.&nbsp; At another there are old tracks,
        marked in red, left by some sort of tractor
        vehicle but for what reason cannot be stated for certain.&nbsp; Whatever
        has been going on, the plateau in the profile gives the impression of being man-made
        and features like some crevices suggest being probably a result of that disturbance.&nbsp; The lower 'bulge' near
        the towpath is simply not there in archival photographs taken early in
        the 20th century with a vague suggestion that some movement was seem by
        1960 - see links immediately below.&nbsp; No similar profile changes
        have been noticed on the other side of the
        cutting. </td>

        It has been 200 years since the gently sloped sides of the cutting were
        formed.&nbsp; After 100 years a councillor notes in 1905 that the bank
        has given away (somewhat?) and this can be taken as the result of clay
        movement due to its weight and its water content.&nbsp; An old-timer
        recalls as a boy in the 1930s that the lower slopes were grassed and
        joined the towpath without a step as shown in archival pictures.&nbsp;
        He remarks that there was some &quot;drop&quot; at the top that was too
        inconvenient to walk down by.&nbsp; But at the ironstone railway and at
        the bend in Stoke Road there was a well worn path straight down to the
        towpath from the road.&nbsp; He said that on some summer days there were
        dozens and dozens of people just messing about or relaxing &quot;under
        the trees&quot; - an idyllic scene that will never return.&nbsp; Since
        the cutting was dug in blue lias clay, which tends to support briars,
        ivy and moss &amp;c., the grassed area must have been encouraged originally by
        applying a layer of more loamy soil.&nbsp; Such fertility has gone -
        further evidence that a simple 'slump' movement alone is not a
        sufficient explanation of what has happened.
        <p>On the assumption that the physical condition of the clay slope and
        the effects of nature in the last 50 years were the same as in the first
        150, we would expect some worsening of the subsidence at the top of the
        profile, after the 50 years, but little change at the bottom near the towpath where a grassy
        area of uniform slope should still be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">Fortunately there have been more photographs which have
      come to light and an approximate account of the modification of the&nbsp;
      profile of the embankment over the last 200 years is given in <a href="monitor-road.htm"> a separate
      document</a> that concentrates on the future welfare of the road.&nbsp; It has been pointed
        out to me by John Mallard that many of the trees in the recent photos
        above are leaning towards the canal.&nbsp; As trees tend to grow
        vertically, this indicates that the surface profile has changed during
        the lifetime of the trees.&nbsp; This detail is consistent with the
      account.</p>
