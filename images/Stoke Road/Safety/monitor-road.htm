        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The comments below, against
        each of the four profiles shown above, constitute a theory to explain
        the profile changes in the canal-side embankment by the north portal of
        Blisworth Tunnel.&nbsp; The change since 1805 is of course irreversible
        and has led to a certain loss of amenity near the towpath (whose width
        has been accidentally exaggerated above) and a concern for the stability
        of the road surface which has required attention twice in recent
        years.&nbsp; This document finishes with an amateur assessment of the
        road surface profile with the intention of comparing it with new data
        taken at one year intervals in the future.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>1805</b>&nbsp; The heights
        above sea-level of the canal water and Stoke Road (near Greenside) are
        90m and 106m respectively.&nbsp; The red line shows a straight profile
        between the two levels as this is what one imagines <a href="canal_cutting.htm"> the engineer
        James Barnes</a>
        would have ensured.&nbsp; The subsoil is mostly blue clay yet a grassy
        bank populated with trees is evident by 1900.&nbsp; The blue clay must
        have been covered with some top soil.&nbsp; There is no photographic
        record of the profile at this date.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>1900</b>&nbsp; Some slump
        was observed by councillors at about this time in the ground near the
        road.&nbsp; Common sense suggests that a clay mass over a long period
        would slump and tend to make the canal narrower.&nbsp; The green line
        shows this effect schematically.&nbsp; Periodically, some dredging and
        trimming of the towpath would have maintained canal width so that by
        1982, when the last known major dredge was carried out the canal width
        is shown restored.&nbsp; There is <a href="canal_cutting.htm#archives"> ample evidence</a> of a steady transition
        from grassy bank to towpath from this time up to 1940.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>1982</b>&nbsp; Maintaining
        canal width involves putting material back onto the bank.&nbsp; The red
        line thus shows a bulge near the towpath and shows also considerable
        progress on the slumping of the bank near the road.&nbsp; By this time
        there was some removal of trees (local lore!) on the bank which could have worsened
        the rate of slump.&nbsp; What happened in 1982 was the preparation of
        the area around the tunnel mouth for the tunnel repairs project.&nbsp;
        The towpath was once again cleared partially to allow small vehicle
        access along it.&nbsp; <a href="../../tunnel-1982.htm#start">This photograph</a> (in the tunnel repair section)
        shows the shaping of soil near the towpath immediately prior to draining
        the canal for lorry access into the tunnel.&nbsp; How the red line shows
        the slump near the road is the result of guesswork.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><a name="clay"></a>1985</b>&nbsp; By the end
        of the tunnel repairs <a href="../../tunneltwo-1982.htm#finish"> there
        was a picture taken</a> which shows that the banking
        near the towpath had been increased since 1982.&nbsp; Relatively recently it has
        been observed that this banking has been 'over-dressed' with some blue
        clay (it was brown earth in 1985 but stubbornly supports mostly moss at
        present).&nbsp; In walking around the area it strikes one that (a) <a href="canal_cutting.htm#clayetc"> blue
        clay has been moved around</a> at some point (perhaps in the 1980s), (b) the
        surface in much of the embankment area is now nearly level and (c) the
        slumping near the road is at 45 to 60 degrees over much of the length of
        the road as it passes by the embankment area.&nbsp; In the rather level
        central region it is tempting to think that blue clay has actually been taken
        away - hence the indicator 'Loss ?' in the above schematic.&nbsp; In
        some correspondence last year, British Waterways people tell me that no material
        would have been taken away and that the profile slumping is due mainly
        to perfectly natural processes, partly accelerated by surface water from
        and/or through the road resulting in a softening of the clay, and that
        may all be correct.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Since 1985 the Stoke Road <a href="../../Stokerd02.htm#trafficlights"> has
        been repaired twice</a> because of its slumping.&nbsp; There has also
        been installed a <a href="Barrier.htm">traffic safety barrier</a>
        because of the hazard presented by the considerable drop adjacent to the
        roadside.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><a name="survey"></a>A comparison of the
        triangular sections of clay
        and/or earth shown in the schematic above, labelled 'A' and 'B', suggests that the
        foundation of the road is supported laterally far less now than it was in
        1900 thus promoting more freedom for the clay beneath the road to be
        compressed by the weight of traffic and be squeeze laterally.&nbsp;
        Compared to 1900, of course, the traffic can now include vehicles of weight up to 44 tonnes instead of
        being typified by a loaded
        horse and cart.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Following what was purely a hunch really, it was thought
        wise to sample the tilt of the Stoke Road, each year, in an amateur
        data-collection project using a spirit level.&nbsp; The diagram below
        tells us what the average 'camber' of the road surface is, towards the
        embankment, at regular intervals of about 20 yards.&nbsp; It is expressed
        <b> as inches of
        level difference across the road</b> and the traces are dated
        April 2009 (data points
        in red) and March 2010 (data points in blue).</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="road-camber-April2009,10.jpg" width="600" height="336"></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">&quot;<b>End</b>&quot; refers
        to the end of the safety barrier nearest to Greenside, &quot;<b>30</b>&quot;
        to the speed restriction signs at the allotment entrance and &quot;<b>CP</b>&quot;
        to the first encountered edge of the tunnel car-park.&nbsp; The road is
        5.5m wide and the spirit level is 36&quot; long.&nbsp; Consequently the scope
        for errors in readings just taken at the midline of the road is
        considerable - the 'error bars' just relate to the job of reading the
        bubble.&nbsp; For readings that translate to over 12&quot; the bubble is
        very near its indicating limit and so a modified level was used to check
        the results.&nbsp; The readings taken between the 30 and the cottages may change because
        the road may need repairing there around some works on drains.&nbsp;In
        addition, it was noticed that the centre line of the road where the
        major repairs were made in 2002 there is some separation and a drop in
        the level indicating the opening of a fissure in the foundations. No conclusion can be reached
        until some comparisons can be made, other than the camber is quite
        noticeable at the gentle corner by the allotment entrance and it is
        unlikely the road was built that way.</font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><a name="latest"></a>Changes over the eleven
        months April 09 to Mar 10 are not really significant considering the
        crudity of the measurement technique.&nbsp; The <b>NCC</b> made an
        assessment of the road by surveying in early February 10 and therefore
        now have a baseline.&nbsp; This assessment shows that despite the appearance
        of cracks in the centre of the road by the cottages there has not been
        much change recently to the general tilt of the road.&nbsp; In November
        2010 the <b>NCC</b> decided to fill the central cracks with a tar
        sealant to prevent frost damage during the winters.&nbsp; By the end of
        January 2011 there were narrow cracks developing next to the filling.&nbsp; It is thought
        that the <b>NCC</b> engineers are becoming worried by the heavy vehicles
        that are routinely using the road and that <b>NCC</b> have commissioned
        regular theodolite measurements checking for subsidence.</font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Latest news - February
        2011: </b> Over the
        past year, a drought year, the edge of the road nearest the canal&nbsp;is
        reported to have&nbsp;moved downwards by a very small amount and outwards, towards 'oblivion', by
        roughly half-an-inch.&nbsp; In
        fact, half the road&nbsp;seems to have&nbsp;made this outward movement
        to leave a gap along the centre line of about the same amount - as could
        be clearly seen to all who passed that way.&nbsp; A
        continuing survey is essential to aid interpretation and in particular
        gauge the effects of drought.&nbsp; Although the shifts are rather small, and
        there is no evidence whatsoever that the shift is accelerating, they are
        of magnitude sufficient for one to be concerned of a possible threat to
        the safety of the road on a 5 year timescale - at least that is one
        local amateur opinion.&nbsp; The behaviour, whether continued or merely
        transient, of the rock-cages within the foundation of the road needs to
        be assessed as does the need for the highways department to impose
        future vehicle weight limits.&nbsp; A measure of the <u>short-term</u>
        impact of resting a 44 tonne vehicle on the road could perhaps help an
        understanding but, overall, road users can be sure that the engineers
        within the highways department are well positioned to deal with any
        safety issues.</font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>
