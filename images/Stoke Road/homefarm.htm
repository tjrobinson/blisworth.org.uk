Home Farm, Stoke Road</font></b></p>

<p align="left">The farm had been sold privately by the Duke of Grafton before
the estate<br>
sale in 1919.&nbsp; Much of the land immediately behind the farmhouse had been<br>
turned over for <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Ironstone-part1.htm">ironstone</a> mining (1860 -
1900) consequently the ground was<br>
weak.&nbsp; Mr Erichsen, who moved into Blisworth House in about 1955, bought<br>
the farm and raised pigs.&nbsp; He found a ready market three doors down the<br>
Stoke Road for his pigs; the <a href="../baconfactory.htm">Blisworth Bacon Co.
Ltd</a>.&nbsp; The first image here<br>
unsurprisingly shows pigs rooting at the rear of the house.&nbsp; The second was<br>
probably taken by GF in about 1966 shortly before the house and buildings<br>
were <a href="../Demolition.htm">demolished</a> and the land sold, by Erichsen,
for development, the new<br>
streets being Buttmead, Eastfield and Home Close.</p>

<p align="left">For many years the farm has been associated with a branch
of&nbsp; the Carter family.<br>
In 1838, the Grafton Survey shows the farm, a mere 5 acres, being let to Joseph<br>
Carter.&nbsp; Later, censuses also show the farm with the Carters - more detail
to come.</p>

(farmer) and it was<br>
his son <a href="../Common/housing.htm">who eventually sold to Erichsen</a>.</p>
