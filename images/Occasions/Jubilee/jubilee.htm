        queen has reigned for 60 years and is now aged 86 years - an amazing
        performance that approaches the record reign of Queen Victoria.&nbsp; In
        this era of diminished Royal appreciation it was good to see people
        putting up Union Jack bunting in the week before the Jubilee Day,
        Tuesday 5th June 2012, so that the Royal Oak, the shop, the Village
        Hall, the Football Club pavilion and one or two private houses looked
        the part.&nbsp; There were even a few Union Jacks mounted on the car
        windows, international football event style. Back in the old days we could lay streams of bunting
        <a href="../../SpecOccasion01.htm#bunting"> across
        the High Street</a> but no-one these days would wish to parlay with the
        Highways Department for that aim.&nbsp; The village has celebrated in
        the past the Jubilees for George III, Queen Victoria and George V (run a
        search for jubilee in the home page search-box).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        main thing that makes or breaks any planned celebrations is the weather
        and, this year, it threatened to ruin things - low temperatures and
        scattered rain, being an insult after the sweltering 9 days in May.&nbsp; The
        two main outdoor
        events were 1. a picnic held on the Football field near the pavilion
        including events and even one or two races with eating and drinking continuing in the Club Pavilion and 2. on the Wednesday a Mikron Company
        theatre presentation entitled &quot;Losing the Plot&quot; that was held on
        the allotments, on a grass patch near the bottom area, with all invited
        from the village.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
      main organiser for the picnic event was Estelle Rose but as hinted at above, she couldn't
      guarantee the weather which turned out to be really cool and breezy. Early in the
      schedule, about 1pm the Rector, Andrea Watkins, was surveying the field
      where a few brave picnickers lay on their groundsheets whilst a few more
      huddled in the marques. There was an encouraging show of picnic food
      collected in the club-house where most people had assembled out of the
      cold.&nbsp; Note the &quot;Hey, keep it clean, your missus is coming&quot;
      moment caught on camera.&nbsp; Villagers were asked to come in suitable
      Jubilee headgear and there was a friendly competition for the best Jubilee
      hat, which was won by Maureen Smith. Estelle's must have been a very close
      second! - but an organiser couldn't been seen winning it.&nbsp; The junior
      section of the hat competition was won by Maisy Bull.&nbsp; Then there
      were a few races for the children with the &quot;Catch the Train&quot;
      relay enacted with some spirit.&nbsp; Later in the afternoon the rain began
      but the fun continued; Brenda Sheehan's &quot;Blisworth Ballet
      Dancers&quot; put on a delightful show * followed by
      some country dancing that involved a fair number of the
      spectators too. There was also a competition for the &quot;best&quot;
      dancers in a &quot;Dancing through the Rain&quot; event to tunes from the
      1950s to 1980s.&nbsp; This was won by two young ladies; Ellen Harding and
      Eleanor Hutchinson.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Eventually the rain drove everyone either into the warmth of the
      club-house or into their cars for home.&nbsp; *&nbsp; The ballet dancing wasn't caught by any roving
      photographer, please let the website know if it, in fact, was
      photographed.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Estelle's
      organising helpers were (alphabetical!) Matthew Bodsworth, Norma Bull,
      Linda Hack, Ruth Hazelgrove, Maria McKeown, Ann North, Christine Pinfold,
      Linda Sanderson, Bev Smith, John and Maureen Smith, Jane Underwood and
      Bridgette Wells.&nbsp; Others to thank were Mrs. Irwin for the loan of
      school equipment, Rev. A Watkins and Pastor K. Barker for judging the
      hats, John Smith looked after sound and served as &quot;Compère&quot;,
      Mary Griffin who organised the country dancing and John Woodhouse for the
      donation of a vase as the dancing prize, Brenda Sheehan for the ballet
      dance routines, Bud Rose for the marquees and Trevor Pinfold for the
      transportation of same, Andy Headland for his vigilance at the St John
      Ambulance post, Maria for labelling us all so we could &quot;come and go
      with impunity&quot; and, probably not the last, George Birch as barman in
      the clubhouse. </span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>

      Wednesday there was a bright spell in the evening, a clear sky and a good sunset.&nbsp;
      The Mikron Company
      went ahead with their performance of &quot;Losing the Plot&quot; on the
      allotment field, organised by Jane Percival and the allotment
    committee.&nbsp; It ran from 7.30pm to near ten o'clock including a halftime
    break for wine and nibbles.&nbsp; Stage lights were needed for the second
    half, powered from a vehicle some distance away.&nbsp; The play was about a
    Yorkshire community that was threatened with the loss of their allotments
    due to a desire to develop.&nbsp; The presentation was an
    entertaining mix of narrative, comedy and songs.&nbsp; The write-up on the
    show, <font size="3"> written by Deborah McAndrew, </font>explains, &quot;<font size="3"><i>It told the stories of allotment gardeners, a
    rag-tag bunch of diggers and dreamers. Strong
    personalities frequently clashed over the best treatment for mealy bugs, and
    the annual ‘Heaviest and Longest’ competition was always a time
    when old feuds and new flirtations threatened to undermine the fragile
    peace.&nbsp; Then a man from the council paid a visit
    and the gardeners realised that they must pull together, or forfeit their
    precious plot forever. But could they agree on a strategy? How were they to convince
    the council of the vital role allotments had played in the life of the
    nation for centuries? What were they to do when things inevitably got out of
    hand?</i><br>
    </font>It was thoroughly enjoyed by
      all; who were seated in the front and standing behind, roughly 75 in total.<br>
