        July 2012&nbsp;</b> As
        you can see there must have been something afoot judging by the evening 'tour
        of celebration' by Colin Wakelin and Ann North (ringing a bell, sporting
        a floral hat) in Colin's &quot;Farm- Gator&quot;
        and, in the accompanying Rover 600, there were Pat Masterman (driving, 'on the horn' quite a bit), Beryl Andrews
        (waving a flag ) and Sarah Sykes (also waving a flag ).</font></span></p>

        was <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">an opportunity to celebrate
        the fact that Blisworth recently won the &quot;Best
        Northamptonshire Village&quot;, a competition run by volunteers through
        Northants <b>ACRE</b>. The trophies, no less than three cups, were on display on the deck behind
        Colin: (i) Best Newcomer to the competition, (ii) Best Large Village and
        (iii) Best Overall Winner.&nbsp; The trophies are retained for a year.</span></font></span></p>

        thanks must go to a small but dedicated team led by Sarah Sykes and Pat
        Masterman for
        their efforts this year in putting in the application and presenting the
        village to some visiting judges; thus displaying considerable civic
        pride.&nbsp; That which must also be recorded is our appreciation of a community
        spirit that is plainly abroad in the village evinced, for example by a
        popular pub, a thriving Post Office shop, a recently built new Scout
        meeting hall, a host of societies and groups, both long established and
        new, a bunch of good websites, a responsive parish council and finally an improving canal-side
        especially near the tunnel and a successful
        series of <a href="../Festival/2012/account.htm">Canal Festivals</a>
        that has been organised by the Canal Partnership.</span></font></span></p>

        photographs, stories and the history of the local people.</font></p>
