        to need some help with this item;</b> a Miss Hedger who lives in Spencer
        Bridge Road, Northampton has presented us with a glass tankard bearing
        the inscription &quot;A Present from Blisworth&quot; which was handed
        down by Abel Hurst, brother-in-law of Arthur Robinson who lived on the Courteenhall Road, at one time
        in number 33 and much later at the Bridge Cottage by the &quot;Black
        Bridge&quot;.</span></font></p>
        <p>
        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Arthur came from Milton Malsor as did
        &quot;Pip&quot; Robinson whom it is believed was Arthur's nephew.&nbsp;
        Arthur worked as a groom for the doctors at Grafton Villa - both Doctors
        Richardson and Jeffreson.&nbsp; Later he worked as a gardener at
        Collingtree Grange, home of the notable Mr. Phipps (brewer, pub owner
        and mining investor).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        problem is who had the tankard, or a batch of tankards, made - and
        when?&nbsp; We have enquired with anyone still alive who once ran a shop
        in the village, with no success.&nbsp; Although it is a plain glass tankard, about ½ pint size and
        formed by molding, the inscription is cut by wheel and an abraider and is
        done rather well.&nbsp; The base of the tankard has the simple message -
        &quot;<font size="2"><b>PATENT&nbsp; 6937</b></font>&quot;.&nbsp; The picture below, formed from a series taken as
        the tankard was turned, gives a reasonable idea of its appearance.&nbsp;
        Now it's up to you readers to identify the source . . .&nbsp; A Google
        search for the patent number provides the one lead and it is useful; in
        about 1887 a girl, <a href="http://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=d95fv813ggntgl4cn3uo0r5l21&amp;topic=458445.0">Elizabeth
        Haswell</a>, born in Newcastle was given a Christening Mug with her name
        and birthday etched onto it.&nbsp; It surely looked just like our
        Blisworth tankard, though we have no proof of that, and that means we
        need to think in terms of Blisworth shops, or a shop at &quot;The
        Railway Hotel Gardens&quot;, taking advantage of the tourist trade
        brought by the railways ca. 1880 to 1900.&nbsp; Blank mugs were probably
        made in Birmingham or Staffordshire and then shipped out throughout the country to high
        street engravers.</span></font></p>
