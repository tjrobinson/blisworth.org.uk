        Based on stories and memories from his family and friends, this book
        celebrates the life of George Freeston, historian, collector, gardener
        and lover of life. Born on 19 November 1911, son of the village
        wheelwright and carpenter, George spent his early years working in the
        family firm and later, as the village taxi driver.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; At the outbreak of World War II, George joined the Home
        Guard and then volunteered for the RAF Volunteer Reserve and ended up in
        264 Squadron as an armourer keeping Mosquitoes flying fit. The diary he
        kept while in Europe is the basis for one of the most fascinating
        sections of the book.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; George spent his demobilisation pay on a row of cottages
        which he converted into the home known as Plowmans where he spent the
        rest of his life. It was an Aladdin's cave of treasures, both ornamental
        and useful, with a garden full of wonders, horticultural and structural.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The book also includes chapters on George's
        &quot;happenings&quot;, his people and his honours and is an
        affectionate tribute to an amazing, much loved man.</font></td>
