        on June 25, 2012</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the omissions in Blisworth
        history is a maintained account of the Blisworth Scout Group.&nbsp;
        There are <a href="../GuidesScouts.htm">many photographs</a> taken at
        places and times that are not recorded.&nbsp; There have been many past
        Scout and Guide Leaders whose names had &quot;misted over&quot; but this
        page aims eventually to fill most of the gaps.&nbsp;
        So that the current troop's website, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Times New Roman"> <a href="http://1stblisworth.ukscouts.org.uk/">http://1stblisworth.ukscouts.org.uk/</a>,</span>
        might present some history on its pages, contact was made with this website recently asking for
        copies of many of the
        photographs of earlier scout groups.&nbsp;Rather than support that idea
        it was resolved to assemble here what one can of a historical account using what George
        Freeston offered in 1982 and Sandra O'Connor wrote in 2009 - with some
        editing.&nbsp; That assembled sketchy history follows.</font><p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>2013</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        2014</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In
        the Spring of this year some old records lodged with our past Parish Clerk,
        Tony Lack, came to light and were ejected from their household.
        There was a folder of Scout-related documents and photographs and these
        were 'rescued' and found their way to the First Blisworth scout troop and
        were then passed on to me for recording purposes.
        There was fresh information about the succession of scout leaders and a
        wealth of photographs from a series of camps which were mostly from the
        1930s (ie. with George as the leader and with a camera). I was able to
        note comments from Mick Turton regarding the leaders after ~1980. The leadership
        details have been added into the following paragraphs and the
        coverage of camping trips taken by the troop are collected on <a href="scoutcamps.htm"> a separate
        page</a>. Also, miscellaneous documents are recorded

        Freeston wrote for Blisworth R&amp;A, March/April 1982 </b> (the account
        has been enhanced with details from an old folder):</font>
        <p><font color="#000080">Scouting, which was started by Robert Baden-Powell
        (ex military campaigner from the South
        African conflicts) in 1907, grew at an amazing pace and Blisworth got involved soon
        after 1907. Apparently, &quot;many of
        Baden-Powell's war tactics were applied in peace-time in the form of
        brotherly open-air exercising&quot;. Blisworth’s first Scoutmaster
        was a civil servant named
        Mr. Cheyney, from Pynus Cottages
        and a relative of Bob Young.&nbsp; He was
        assisted by Tom Whitlock (son of Witty Whitlock).
        The first troop was founded
        around 1910 (actually, I believe it was 1907/8 - see first listed
        document above) and a small number joined from Pattishall and Gayton,
        especially for camps held in those parishes. Messengers were taught
        horse riding. Camps were held regularly, but Scouts in those days
        marched to and fro between venues towing the handcart which carried all
        their gear. A field was available to them
        off Dingley Lane (the lane has since disappeared from between Grafton
        House and the new house next to it) for camping practices. The troop
        earned their pathfinder badge from creating a relief map in Plasticine<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font>
        of an area near Blisworth Station. The model was set up in the Infant
        School (The &quot;Stute&quot;), being their headquarters from 1913.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Other notable points are they became ill from creating lemonade in a
        zinc bucket and took advantage of horse riding lessons at Eastcote and
        ambulance lessons at the Stoke Road Westley Bakery. Upon the outbreak of
        war in 1914, some senior scouts camped on Banbury Lane to oversee rail
        movements.&nbsp; From those days we still have (1982) two old Scouts, Mr. W. (Bill)
        Sturgess and Ron Freeston. Brother Ron’s enthusiasm introduced him
        into the realms of signalling, both with morse code and with semaphore.
        He and some other scouts were sent, in 1914, to take part in Coast Guard
        duties at Alderly Creek in Lincolnshire -see item above. From that activity, Ron
        volunteered and joined The Royal Naval Reserve and
        in the war years, as signal officer on the bridge, witnessed cargoes of
        hundreds of horses, in convoys, being shipped from the USA to Britain..</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The first Scout Troop was dismantled during the
        first world war. The rebirth came in 1933 when <a href="../people-four.htm#woolacott"> Mr.
        W.A.Woolacott</a> became Scoutmaster and his assistants (A.S.M.) were <a href="../Miscgroups.htm#caesar"> Richard Caesar</a> and myself.&nbsp;
        That troop enjoyed a period of scouting to the full, camping in Dorset,
        on the East Coast, in Snowdonia and many other localities - see <a href="scoutcamps.htm">
        the camps photos</a>.&nbsp; Notable
        also was the in-village activities arranged by the Scouts, for example a
        series of Whist Drives and Dances usually held at the &quot;Old
        School&quot; (being now the Village Hall). However, a wretched war intervened; a war to which most of the Scouts
        were called, one of these Scouts being a young <a href="../chapelgroups.htm#bodsworth"> Dennis Bodsworth</a> who went
        into the Royal Navy.&nbsp; Anyway, with my calling up the troop came to
        an end. Prior to being called up, many
        young scouts served as bicycled messengers and we
        have a photographic record of this - see above.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">With the WWII over, the idea of scouting niggled in one or
        more heads (should we start up again?) but it was not until 1966 that
        Dennis Bodsworth, who was in the troop before, with the aid of Alan Westell formed a Scout
        troop.&nbsp; Scouting flourished for a second period and it became a
        family involvment for the Bodsworths. I should mention at this stage
        that following the formation of the Scouts, the Rector, the Rev. Bunker
        formed a Cub pack which Mrs. Greta Bodsworth took over in 1970 (actually
        the reverend deemed that scouting activities were perhaps insufficiently
        devotional and he parted company).&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Then, in 1971, a young Stuart Turner of Milton
        Malsor, came over to help with the Scouts, apparently to deal with boredom. He became
        assistant Cub/Scout leader and in 1979 became Leader.&nbsp; A
        daughter of Dennis and Greta Bodsworth became involved in the scouting
        family c 1970 and her husband joined also (maybe this husband was in
        fact S. Turner?). In 1973
        there was the realisation of a dream when the Cubs and Scouts owned a
        new building situated in the northeast corner of the playing
        field.&nbsp; It was a modest affair, built by benefactors, organised by
        Dennis and Greta Bodsworth and fully
        supported by the Parish Council who provided a supply of electricity and
        water and the
        specification of a tiny ground rent. By
        1977 there were 19 Scouts under Scout Masters Eric Warner and Mr. E.
        Harris from Tiffield and 28 Cubs under assistant leaders Mr. and Mrs.
        Stuart Turner with Greta Bodsworth as leader. The cubs of Blisworth (Blisworth
        Pack) got together with many nearby villages as a part of the District
        Scout Movement, attending some church events as well as camping
        competitions. The 1976 camping was won by the Blisworth Pack who took
        1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes . . .</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">In the 1970s the District Scout Movement (being
        the Towcester &amp; District) was represented by Scouts and Cub Packs
        from Whittlebury, Pattishall, Greens Norton, Towcester, Blisworth,
        Pottersbury, Yardley Gobion, Deanshanger and Old Stratford.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Both Mr.
        and Mrs. Bodsworth retired in 1980 from active service for the
        Blisworth Scouts. Dennis Bodsworth took up the role of
        Deputy District Commissioner. Stuart Turner became the Scout Leader.
        It is worthwhile mentioning at this point that in the 1980s there was a
        successful Youth Club held weekly in the Village Hall. It was very well
        attended by up to 60 children run by Colin Gardner. It attracted notoriety
        at times because older youths assembled outside the Hall, smoking and
        drinking alcohol from the shop and the pub. For good or for bad, the
        activities of the 1980s and in subsequent periods diverted some of the momentum
        that would have otherwise supported the scout movement.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">An attempt is made in the following table to
        record the promotions of all the main leaders in the 1st Blisworth
        troop. This
        proved difficult and will involve a few discussions.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080">The rules which affect organised events for
        scouts and cubs were revised over the years. Not only had there to be a
        sufficient number of adults in a supervisory role at all times but it
        was no longer allowed that one adult should ever be separated from
        everyone else with a few minors. This last point made it very difficult
        to organise a trip by private cars to venues offering some challenge (eg.
        hill walking). The last photograph in the <a href="scoutcamps.htm">camps
        page</a> in around 1993 was more or less the last of day trips by car.
        The venue there was the &quot;Packhorse Bridge&quot; near Hathersage in
        Derbyshire.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Activities to which the children's parents can offer transport became
        the norm.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">On this website there were a <a href="../GuidesScouts.htm"> small number of
        photographs</a> that often lacked any caption but since June 2014 it has
        been possible to fill out the account on this page and add many 'camp'
        photographs.&nbsp; Dates are provided where possible and this serves to
        fit them into one of the three phases in which the troop was active in the village.&nbsp;
        Please note that, in addition to Scouts, there were also Guides and Cubs at Blisworth but,
        unfortunately, George Freeston has made little mention of
        them.&nbsp; Pam Ayres was notable in the village and our account of <a href="blisworth&#32;sea&#32;rangers.htm">one
        of her activities</a> will somewhat fill the yawning dark hole.&nbsp; We
        also know that the Girl guides in Blisworth was founded in 1922 by Miss Margaret Tait
        (who lived then at the Loundes in Station Road) and that M.C.Clinch (Blisworth
        House), author of the small history book on Blisworth,
        was &quot;Brown Owl&quot; from February 1935, which was when she formed
        a pack of Brownies for young girls.</font></p>

        </span>This together with our hopes of rebuilding the hut has got us to
        thinking about the history of the group. We celebrated our 40<sup>th</sup>
        birthday in 2006 as the troop was registered with
        the Scout Association by Mr. Bodsworth when the troop was reformed in
        1966.&nbsp;<i> </i>It appears that in 1961/2 there was no group in the
        village but some scouts from Blisworth met at Stoke Bruerne or
        Shutlanger.&nbsp; We
        have a flagpole that was presented to the scout troop on the 19th March1934
        by Mr. &amp; Mrs. E. Caesar. It also records on a ferrule the scout
        master and assistants at the time.</span></font></p>

        re-organisation within the
        Northamptonshire Scout Movement and the 1st Blisworth group transferred
        to the Grafton District grouping which offered contact with even more
        village-based troops than had been the case within the Towcester
        District grouping. Troops from as far separated villages as Middleton
        Cheney and Hartwell were included. The table above covers this event and
