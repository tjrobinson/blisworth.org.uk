        The curious thing about this is that the remaining stone is a gravestone
        from the 17th century. We cannot make out the detail enough to say who
        the deceased was but from our births/deaths record for 1644 there is
        nothing like a match. In the remaining holes are yellow &quot;Rawlplugs&quot;
        probably of 1970s vintage (no earlier) and the fitting looks rather
        professional. The more conventional milestones of Victorian design are
        of solid cast iron, two vertical faces towards the traffic and one
        sloped top bearing a number. So the question is - who did this
        installation? Was it George Freeston?</td>

      <b>22-26</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Staddle Stones.&nbsp; Three or more of equal
      height (if the ground is level) would support a network of wooden planks
      some distance off the ground.&nbsp; This enabled farmers and homesteaders
      to build&nbsp; ricks of straw with corn on the ear out of reach from rats
      or mice who could not get around the overhand.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was best to
      store corn in this way throughout the year rather than turn it into flour
      that would fill the small houses and wouldn't keep well anyway.
      <p>The ricks needed to be securely thatched to ward off the rain and keep
      sparrows from getting at the corn.&nbsp; However, sparrows became very
      adept at burrowing . . .

        <p><b>22-27</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sept 1992 the
        area experienced about 5 inches of rain in one day.&nbsp; The general
        area to both the west and the south-west of Northampton was affected and
        all this area drains through the canalised section of the River Nene at
        Northampton.&nbsp; The town experienced severe flooding while Blisworth
        demonstrated that its lowest point in the Gayton Road by the mill was
        capable of being flooded.&nbsp; The canal, just off the picture to the
        left, reached the top of its bank and this water is perhaps just a few
        inches higher than that.</p>
        <p>It is thought that this area was the site of a ford across the brook
        (Fisher Brook) in Saxon times.&nbsp; Even with a bridge at the bottom of
        High Street, the ford would have been used regularly for animals -
        possibly right up to the 18th century.&nbsp; Neither ford nor brook are
        shown on earliest maps (Grafton 1727) but that is not indicative as the
        maps were drawn to help the Duke deal with rent collection and land
        allocation.<br>
