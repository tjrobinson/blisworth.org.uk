        Account of Photographic History (from a 1966 article, NRO)</b>&nbsp; When
        Walter Alexander was a young man, a camera was considered a
        professional's tool or a rich man's luxury. Small wonder that he had
        little or no encouragement when he wanted to own a camera. His first
        camera, therefore, was homemade, a cardboard box three inches square
        with only a pin hole for the aperture. His next cost a shilling and his
        third 5s. 6d. The fourth was presented to him by the late Mr. C. H.
        Battle at the Corn Exchange, Northampton, as a prize, valued at 10s. and
        won in an arts and crafts competition organised by the Band of Hope. Mr.
        Alexander then progressed to a quarter plate camera with tripod and,
        after doing extra part-time work, purchased his sixth camera, the half
        plate camera and tripod he still has today. This has produced some 5,000
        plates over a period of 45 years and he regards it as an inanimate
        friend. With this and later cameras he has produced many prize-winning
        photographs and has exhibited throughout the Midlands as well as having
        his work published. His subjects have been landscapes, vegetation and
        architecture that were usually taken while he was on cycling trips
        around the county, burdened with the camera and tripod. Some items stand
        out in his memory. For example, taking photographs of German prisoners
        at the end of WWI. By profession, Mr. Alexander was a horticulturist but
        an unfortunate unlucky bomb in World War II damaged his greenhouses at
        Blisworth. Due to other circumstances many of his historic half plates
        were lost and that included some of his earliest canal photographs.</font>
        <p style="padding-left: 80; padding-right: 80; padding-bottom: 50"><font color="#000080">The
        most recent coverage of his achievements appears in a newspaper article dated Feb 1966,
        which describes an exhibition of his photography held in the Sun, Moon and Stars
        &quot;Gallery&quot; when Walter Alexander was 80.&nbsp; The Alexander
        family put on a show of some of his photographs in the Baptists Chapel
        lecture hall in 2011.&nbsp; There was however not much space because of
        other displays and only a few photographs that have not been displayed
        before were hung.&nbsp; Nevertheless the reminder was a pleasant one.</font></p>
