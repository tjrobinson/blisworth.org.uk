        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;

        Once the tree had acquired roads on three sides of near equal status,
        the triangle became first a haven for the council to deposit heaps of
        road repair gravel.&nbsp; They were deterred and resolved to only use
        the 'green' in front of Grafton House being a tradition from the 1920s.
        <p>Not long passed and an outbreak of parking beside the tree was
        noticed.&nbsp; The parish council frowned on this right up to the time
        when (1973 - the time of the Arab imposed panic?) we were no longer
        expected to use sidelights when parking.&nbsp; As the council's argument
        was chiefly about confusion with lights on the triangle, they gave up
        then.

        <p><b>13-11 </b>&nbsp; This marks the obliteration of the site of the
        elm tree in 1984.&nbsp; It was struck by lightning in Sept 1965 - the
        remaining stump is shown below.&nbsp; In late 1965 it was decapitated at
        a height of about ten feet and given &quot;a 12 month reprieve for new
        growth&quot;.&nbsp; Rather longer than 12 months was allowed - in April
        1970 there were plans to incorporate the stump into a novel design of
        bus shelter.&nbsp; The shelter was built in 1971/2 but the stump was set
        on fire in July 1972 and the shelter followed suit in another fire in
        October 1972.&nbsp; The miscreants who did these deeds would be about
        fifty now - it's to be hoped they will read this.</p>
        <p>Eventually it was decided by the council in 1984 to totally remove the tree stump and create a rather featureless road island planted with
        some &quot;road furniture&quot;.&nbsp; In 1994, the island was joined with the pavement to the right when some revisionist traffic
        consultants arrived in the village to <a href="Calming.htm"> calm the
        traffic</a>.</p>
