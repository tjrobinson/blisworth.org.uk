Photo: T Newcombe, 1957</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cottage is recorded in the hands of
Mrs Hill, only, in 1952,<br>
and the &quot;Old Boot Shop&quot; as 'void' which
indicates that Mr. Hill had died and the shop had<br>
closed.&nbsp; By 1957 the roof
looks decidedly tatty.&nbsp; Note the seat placed near the bus stop was<br>
provided by
the late Alfred Westley.&nbsp; The seat was renewed and placed by the Royal Oak<br>
by 1970.&nbsp; That seat was removed in 2005 - it is to be hoped the parish
council ensure that it<br>
is replaced.<br>
The bus stop for Milton and Northampton was just off the picture
to the left.&nbsp; In
icy conditions,<br>
the bus sometimes experienced difficulties moving off from the
bus stop as
spinning rear wheels<br>
allowed the tail of the bus to slide down Chapel
Lane.</p>

<p align="left">Below is a recent picture taken from the same spot.&nbsp; The house in the background, built c.<br>
1965 when the boot shop was demolished, was Bob Young's
new bungalow at the time, to<br>
which he would eventually retire.&nbsp; The other
cottage was once
accommodation for two families<br>
and was extensively rebuilt as one in the early 1980s.&nbsp; It is identifiable
on the 1727 Grafton<br>
estate map, along with dozens of other houses but the 'boot shop' building was
built between<br>
1757 and 1839.<br>

Hill was an apprentice to John Green's father.</p>
