        A Short
        History of Blisworth Schools</font></b> </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first recorded school in
        Blisworth was one endowed by Roger Wake in 1504.&nbsp; It was a free
        school with annual financing of £11 which was expected to have attracted a teacher of
        quality such as a Graduate of Oxford.&nbsp; The charter was to teach
        children to read and write, to learn certain scriptures, in Latin, and
        provide a church choir.&nbsp; As many poor children as brought to the
        school would be taught alongside the paying scholars.&nbsp; With the passing of centuries the annuity had diminished
        due to inflation - by 1710 the curate was headmaster and the school
        had then effectively become a C.of E. school.&nbsp; The endowment had
        been commutated by single payment to the church but the school was still referred to
        as an &quot;endowed&quot; school.&nbsp; George Freeston spent much time
        in London copying extracts from the Episcopal court hearings and so
        revealed a couple of dubious schoolmasters from the past, viz. Mr
        Wiggington (c.1594) and Mr Perman (c.1650) - both serious drunkards!&nbsp; Despite
        George's efforts, information prior to 1800 is very sparse though <a href="SchoolRev/school-detail.htm">two
        extracts</a>, one of which paints an impression of 17th century neglect,
        are here reproduced from his 2002 collection.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the earliest
        times the school might have occupied the same site in the Stoke road as the
        &quot;old school&quot; shown above - next to the <a href="Stokerd01.htm"> Westley's house</a> and
        bakery.&nbsp; In <a href="Greatfire.htm"> the great fire</a> of 1798, Westley's property was destroyed
        along with the school.&nbsp; Joseph Westley snr. immediately re-built
        his house, end-on to the road, and to do so he bought a strip of school land
        to accommodate it.&nbsp; The side of the house can be seen in the left of
        the picture above.&nbsp; Westley's purchase was generous, £40 being
        paid, and it allowed the church to rebuild the school within a short
        time.&nbsp; It has also been stated that the school was not rebuilt until 1815
        but document NRO35p/197/2 seems to contradict this.&nbsp; The
        building looked something like that shown above and set right against the side
        of the Westley house.&nbsp; By 1845 an additional school was required
        but the Duke of Grafton refused to sell the land.&nbsp; It was to be
        another &quot;church school&quot; and the Duke found fault with those
        directing education at the time (ie. the Rector) on the grounds that the
        school should be managed with inputs being heeded from <u> all</u> the ratepayers.&nbsp;
        He was concerned that Baptist family children would not be treated well
        but unfortunately this principle was not heeded.&nbsp; Families that could afford it would send their boys
        (perhaps only first born) to Courteenhall School and the Baptists set up
        a junior school for their children adjacent to the Chapel.&nbsp; A few
        sent their elder children to a non-denominational 'National' school in
        Roade.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the
        expansion in the village due to the railways, space must have been very
        short.&nbsp; In 1861, in response to the Elementary Education Act of
        that year, a board of managers was elected from the ratepayers.&nbsp;
        The structure of this new management is more complex than first thought
        - a member of the Wake family signed approval for the Rev T Barry to be
        headmaster in 1861 (NRO, 35pc/197-1) which suggests ongoing trouble for
        Baptist children.&nbsp; Also in 1861 to satisfy the
        new Act, the school building was extended to provide more space and
        light, ie. to the form pictured above rather than one which stood back from the
        road.&nbsp; In 1874 an extension building for infants was agreed (a later
        Duke!) and was built directly on the other side of Stoke Road.&nbsp;
        With the management of Blisworth school, designated by then as &quot;Endowed School
        No. 20&quot;, being shared by church, the board of ratepayers and the county
        authorities in the early part of the 20th century, the inspectors found
        considerable fault as they did of the schools in most villages.&nbsp;
        Because of a
        countrywide overhaul of education, a completely new school was proposed
        in 1907.&nbsp; It was designated
        as a &quot;County Council School&quot; being at last formally able to
        cater for children
        from Anglican and non-conformist families.&nbsp; It was finished in
        1913, situated at the <a href="Elmtree.htm"> Old Elm Tree</a>  corner
        after briefly considering a site further up the Courteenhall Road on the
        opposite side. </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next picture, <b>36-02</b>
        taken in 1918, the school is to the left and the head-teacher's house to
        the right.&nbsp; Below that is <b>36-03</b>, taken in 1952, showing the
        main entrance of the school on the Courteenhall Road.&nbsp; It is
        thought that the main building in the Stoke Road was closed in 1913 but the infant school
        remained in operation until 1915 whereupon all children were transferred to
        the new school which was, from then on, to be run as a single
        department.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then there have been numerous
        improvements and extensions to the new school.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile the
        &quot;Old School&quot; has been under-utilised and the infant school has
        become a residence.&nbsp; In the 1970s, the &quot;Westley&quot; house, then
        owned by Buswell's (the British Bacon Company), was pulled down to leave
        the gaunt flat side of the the old school.&nbsp; In 1977 the old school
        was renovated and extended to become the <a href="Articles/village_hall.htm"> Village
        Hall</a>. </p>
