        Towcester with Stratford-on Avon and once combined with the N&amp;BJ

         Immediately north of the Station signal box was a  large metal column, removed by 1970 when photo
         <b> 27-21</b> was taken although  what looks like its base is there. The column,
         as can be just discerned above, had a large leather hose through which a huge quantity of water could flow. The practice was for  the engine to stop with its tender opposite the column, the fireman  would climb on top of the tender, open a cover and insert the leather
         hose and the driver then turned a hand wheel on the ground which released  the flow of water into the tender. Care was necessary when the tender  was full as any overflowing would soak the fireman
         - there was no health and safety  in those days!<br>

      Mr Stanton, the superintendent for the SMJ railway, c1900, had his office
      at Blisworth and used an interesting mode of transport - one that could
      only have been used on a rather quiet branch line!
      <p>He was approached by letter in 1907 in regard to collecting railway
      stamps (yes, rail memorabilia was collected that far back!) and <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Railways/stampcollector.jpg">the

        Hotel in the evening. On the following day the entire staff of the SMJ
