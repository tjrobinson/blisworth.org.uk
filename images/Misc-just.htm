        <p>Part of a Psalm painted in a corner of a main room in Elm Tree House opposite the
        school.&nbsp; In the early part of the 20th century it was the house of
        Frank Young, Oliver Young's brother (not his son Frank).&nbsp; More
        recently the house was occupied by the late George Clarke - a &quot;real
        village character&quot;.&nbsp; The Psalm is number 143, v. 10 -
        &quot;Teach me to do thy will for thou art my God: let thy good spirit
        lead me into righteousness&quot;.&nbsp; Though not specially significant
        for Baptists, the prayer is associated with those in a predicament or
        under stress.&nbsp; The style has been dated c. 1650 and the script may
        well have been put there by a dissident of Baptist faith.</p>

        the strong growing land behind the garage on the Northampton Road (now a
        car sales centre) was let to a Dutch couple who grew flowers.&nbsp; The
        caravans in the background are for hire or sale and formed the beginning
        of the caravan sales business also on the Northampton Road.&nbsp; The

        <p>In the narrow field which became the Gayton Marina (located in
        Blisworth Parish!)&nbsp; The digging is for puddling clay for canal
        repairs in 1965.&nbsp; It is tempting to think that this pit and the one which
        became known as Gayton Tip were clay pits or brickworks at the time of
        the building of the canal.&nbsp; However, puzzlingly, neither are recorded on any
        19th century map whether by GJC, Ordnance Survey or Grafton Survey.&nbsp;
        In 1919 the Grand Union Canal Company bought the land from the Duke of
        Grafton.&nbsp; The reason was not specified in a letter of
        recommendation from <a href="Canal/millner.htm"> Thomas Millner</a> to the head office but, being a
        stones throw from Millner's own house, the land probably suggested
        itself fit for some development or other.&nbsp; It became a <a href="Canal/Arm/Arm-general.htm"> narrow boat
        Marina in the 1970s</a> whilst other parts of the strip were used as a
        canal-based petrol depot in the 1930's.</p>
