        This is the lift bridge, serving a right of way, over the Arm at one of
        the locks.&nbsp; It is photographed in 1962 and in 2000 by J Payler,
        whose photographs well adorn the various canal pages.&nbsp; It came to
        our notice that the bridge is listed at the time of the routing of <a href="bypass_planning.htm">the
        Blisworth Bypass</a> in 1986.&nbsp; The new bypass runs parallel to the
        Northampton Arm for some distance and was shifted in the planning phase
        21 metres further away from the canal for reasons of amenity.
