A problem with
&nbsp;the idea that it was the 'school' of 1871 put up at the time of the second
phase of thee <a href="Chapel/1865-Enlargements.htm">building programme along
with the enlargement
of the Chapel</a> is that it carries the&nbsp;date 1885 on its gable facing the Chapel Lane.&nbsp; It is necessary
therefore to surmise that the building was extended
&nbsp;in 1885.&nbsp; The brickwork of
the lecture hall does appear to have been&nbsp;erected in phases.&nbsp;&nbsp;There seem to be no records to clarify this
uncertainty.</font></td>

An early picture of the organ, the same one as below but with a much
more modest array of pipes.&nbsp; As stated below, it was installed in 1891 and
        replaced the use of a harmonium which, on several occasions from 1884,
        required repairs.&nbsp; The harmonium continued to be used in one of the
        other rooms and after 1904 nothing more is recorded about it.<br>
 Just when the pipes revision occurred to the main organ in the church is
not known - certainly after 1919.&nbsp; Note the suspended oil lamps.</font></td>

The organ carries a plaque; &quot;Presented to the Baptist Church of Blisworth
by <a href="People.htm"> Mr Joseph Westley</a> and Family in Commemoration of his 70th Birthday March 21st
1891-Opened June 11th 1891.&quot;&nbsp; It was powered by a manual bellows which
were upgraded with an electric motor in 1950 by the kindness of Mrs. Alfred
Westley. Maybe the
larger pipes were obtained then - demanding the extra air supply.</font></td>

A view from the Pond Bank field, before any houses were built there, shows the
very<br>
steep nature of the old graveyard.&nbsp; As can be seen from the extra height of
the walling<br>
towards the bottom, much soil was imported in an attempt to lessen the gradient
and<br>
such action is mentioned in the 19th century account.</font></td>
