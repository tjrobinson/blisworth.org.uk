<p>The tree in the diagram below is a partial tree to illustrate most of the
findings so far.&nbsp; It could be proved incorrect as further facts are brought
to light.&nbsp; 'Birth/Marriage/Death' information is indicated by b./m./d. in
the tree <i><b>BUT</b></i> it was generally <u>burials</u> and <u>christenings</u>
that were actually recorded in those days.</p>
<p>Footnotes are collected below for some of the family members.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b><u>NOTES</u></b></p>

<p>1.&nbsp; A John Staughton of Blisworth is imprisoned in 1685-6 and a John, a
baker, certified his house as a meeting house in 1701.&nbsp; It is not certain which of
the two John's in the family apply and they may have both been bakers.&nbsp; John senior was probably born c. 1612
so that he would have been about 73 when imprisoned and about 89 when the house was
certified.&nbsp; John junior would have been 49 and 65 respectively at those
times and seems by today's standards the more likely John for both of the
records.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; These two children are the only two mentioned in John junior's will
in 1716.&nbsp; One can only speculate the reasons for that.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; This according to the Long Buckby records.&nbsp; William was the
grandfather of the notable William Staughton, son of Sutton Staughton, in the USA<br>

<p>4.&nbsp; Elizabeth is the great aunt of the same William in the USA and
so we can represent William and Elizabeth as brother and sister in the tree.<br>

<p>5.&nbsp; In the porch of Blisworth Church is a headstone, which was recovered
from the graveyard and set up by George Freeston, recording as follows; &quot;here
lyeth Grace y. wife of William
Stauton&quot;. </p>

<p> It was presumably this William Staughton that occupied the farm house now
known as Crieff House in the village centre.&nbsp; In fact, as indicated in the
1660 Grafton Survey, he (written as Willm Stalton) appears to have a shared
occupancy of that house and the Home Close with it. </p>
