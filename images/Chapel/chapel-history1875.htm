<p ALIGN="left"><font size="3">THE BAPTIST CHAPEL AT BLISWORTH&nbsp; </font></b>
An event of no small interest, namely, the jubilee (the 50th anniversary} of the
Baptist Chapel of this village, was celebrated on Wednesday week. The day's
proceedings commenced with a breakfast, given to the Sunday-school children, and
the old men who were present at the opening of the chapel half a century ago.
Eight of these old gentlemen were seated on a separate form, and their ages
amounted to 600 years, giving an average of 75. Breakfast over, the children
repaired to the school-room, where they sang suitable hymns, after which they
were conducted to those parts of the village most noted in connection with the
Baptist cause. At each place they sang. They then adjourned to a field, kindly
lent by Mr. Westley. In<i> </i>the afternoon a service was held in the chapel,
the sermon being preached by the Rev. E. G. Gange, of Broadmead, Bristol,
succeeded by a communion service, which was conducted by the Rev. G. Jarman in
the unavoidable absence of the Rev. J. T. Brown. A tea-meeting was subsequently
held, followed by a crowded meeting in the chapel, the Rev. J. T. Brown
presiding.</p>
<p align="left">After having expressed the interest be always felt in the
welfare of Blisworth, the Chairman contrasted the present spread of the gospel
with the condition of Christianity in times past, and spoke of the many changes
that had taken place everywhere in that period, both in the political world and
in society, but more especially in social life. Dealing more especially with the
changes in this neighbourhood, he pointed to the time when railroads and the
electric telegraph had not been made. Commerce and industry had increased, the
result of the extension and application of steam. Considering political changes,
our forefathers had very little liberty 50 years ago. They struggled for that
political liberty which we enjoyed today. He referred more particularly to the
passing of the Reform Bill, which he characterised as the most glorious
achievement of this century when the political power of this nation was extended
and people began to feel that they had power and when the feelings of the people
began to be expressed. The next glorious achievement gained after the fiercest
struggle, and having for its object the raising of the low and oppressed, and
the help of the needy, was the liberation of the slaves. Fifty years ago some of
those present were children, lisping at their mother's knee, but now they were
grown to manhood, and their children, and, in some instances, their
grandchildren, came lisping the same as they had done in former years. All this
was the work of fifty years. With reference to their church, in contrasting the
present with the past, he pointed out the progress that had been made. Although
they were not equal to their fathers in conviction, and earnest fidelity, there
was at the present time more intensity of life and greater activity in Christian
life, but not so much personal communication with the truth. Referring to the
changes wrought in the homes of the people, he dilated upon the improvements
that had been made and, in conclusion, appealed to all to live close to God
after the manner of their fathers, and by all they deemed sacred and good,
showing that they rejoiced in the goodness of the Lord God for the past fifty
years, and that they were men prepared to express their gratitude by a new and
better devotion, such as their lives required from them.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. Mills, pastor of the chapel, then read the following paper on the
history of the church:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 30">&quot;The year was 1780, the place Hartwell, where were celebrated all the
festivities of a happy marriage between John Goodridge and Ann Blunt. The usual
wedding tour at an end, the bridal couple returned to their new home in the
parish of Blisworth. This was the beginning of the Baptist cause in this
village. We are told in an autograph MS of this gentleman that he was brought up
as a member of the Church of England, and in early years became a devout
worshipper according to its formularies, but as his intelligence developed, he
felt that neither its polity nor its doctrines were in Harmony with the
Christian's infallible guide, so he abandoned the Church of his fathers, and
cast in his lot with a people whose mode of thought and worship were more
congenial to his soul.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 30">&quot;Some years prior to his coming to Blisworth, he had heard of
Nonconformist ministers and laymen preaching here, but for some unknown reasons,
it had been discontinued, and at this time all who wished to worship in public
were compelled to attend the adjoining church or walk a considerable distance.
Mr<i> </i>Goodridge soon discovered a few kindred minds, among others of Mr.
Robert Campion, who was one with him in heart, mind, purpose, and zeal. These
agreed to meet together at each other's houses alternately for prayer. After
this they secured a room, and licensed it for preaching, getting a sermon as
often as possible by one of the neighbouring ministers, and in the absence of
this, one of the number read, a sermon and others engaged in prayer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 30">&quot;But there was trouble in store for this little hill of Zion, and the
rector (Rev. Trotter) found that many of his flock preferred the humble cottage worship to that
of the consecrated pile, and set himself against the prosperity of the place
most strenuously. He urged the wandering ones to return to his fold, and
threatened that if they failed to do so, they would leave no stone unturned to
deprive them of the room. They heeded not his voice, and in a very little time
the steward gave them notice to quit. For a time they were compelled to return
to the old plan of meeting for prayer in each other's houses, and one of the
most earnest petitions was that God would set an open door for the Gospel in
this village. For a moment bigotry was in the ascendant, but our fathers were
not made of a material that could be broken; they could bend under oppression,
but only to return to the manliness and assert their rights as soon as it would
be wise to do so. To try to quench the flame of liberty that burned in their
breasts was like to a pouring of water on spirit-oil: it caused the flame to
spread and to burn more furiously. For a time, it was true, Nonconformity seemed
to writhe in its dying agony, but it was like the receding wave of the rising
tide: it retired to gather fresh strength to carry it to its highest flood. A
true sympathiser with these brethren was the Rev. Sir. Goode, of Towcester, This
gentleman was asked to see his Grace the Duke of Grafton, to ask him to permit a
building of one of his tenants to be licensed as a place of worship. After
laying before him all the circumstances of the case, not forgetting the
opposition of the rector, his Grace promised to come to Blisworth and see to it.
The promise was kept. He learned who were the leading men, and was told that it
was Mr. Campion's barn they wished to make a chapel of. His Grace had an
interview with the modem Pharoah, who knew not Joseph and would not let Israel's
people go, and said to him, &quot;Well Trotter, why can't you let these people
alone; they are some of my best tenants. They shall have a meeting house!&quot;
Permission was given; a part of the old barn was partitioned off, and made fit
for an assemblage of worshippers, and in October, 1789, the Rev. Mr. Goode and
Dr. Ryland preached opening sermons.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 30">&quot;From this time it was under the pastoral charge of Mr. Heighton, of
Roade, who at first came one Sunday evening out of the four, then three, and
eventually every Sabbath evening, and occasionally in the week. The seed was
sown, and in 1807 the harvest came, seven adults joined the Church at Roade, and
in the same year a Sunday school was first opened and many children hopefully
converted. God was with them on [sic] a truth; the partition had to be taken
down, and the whole barn used for worship. Still the cause grew, and people had
to stand about the door to hear the Word of God. To make room for the adults, it
was resolved to dismiss the children when the service began. It pained them much
to have to do this, and first one said, and then another, we ought to have a
chapel. Friends of the neighbourhood were consulted; all agreed that as Mr.
Campion had offered to sell [1] them a piece of ground, it should be secured and a
chapel erected.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 30">&quot;Once convinced of what they ought to do, they were prompt to act; and
one morning three or four friends met at one house, and thence of [sic] the
Church of God. The age in which they lived was certainly a very busy one.
Science had striven for the goal, and commerce had pushed on.&quot;</p>
<p>He rejoiced with them because they possessed those principles which
strengthened and solaced their fathers, and which, to his knowledge, accompanied
them to their death. He concluded by praying that the richest blessings might
rest upon them.<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO"> </font>The Rev. T. How,
of Roade, succeeded, and with a few remarks expressed his pleasure at being able
to be present, and briefly referred to the troublous times through which they
bad passed.<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO"> </font>The Rev. S. E.
Bradfield, of Bushden, then gave an address. He pointed out that although they
had been very successful in past years, there still remained a great work to be
accomplished. There were hands willing to do the work, but they lacked the fire
which possessed their forefathers, and it therefore behoved them to work
energetically so that that there might be no idlers in the Church, and the
Church might be blessed. The Lord would be with them, and they need not fear. Of
those who built this place 50 years ago many had gone to their rest, and they
had encouraged their children to work for Christ. This should be done by the
present fathers, so that their children might take up the cause when seniors
should have passed away.<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO"> </font>The Rev.
G. Bailey shortly addressed the audience, followed by the Bev. E. G. Gange, who
commenced speaking of the happy time he had spent with the Rev. J. Mills, while
a scholar at Bristol College, and after referring to the fact that Dr. Ryland,
formerly pastor of the Broadmead Chapel, Bristol, was present at the formation
of this church 50 years-ago, he said there seemed a little fitness that he, as a
successor of Dr. Ryland, should be present on this occasion.</p>
<p><a name="roman"></a>He then spoke of the many gatherings that had taken place in the chapel
during the last half century. Where, he asked, would they be in fifty years
hence ? Many would be beneath the sod, and he hoped that those who had passed
away would be with God. It mattered little where the body would be cast; it
might be in the ocean depths, in the quiet churchyard, or high up in mountain
tops and crags. He was glad to think that the Church of England had not so much
power now as it had fifty years ago. Now they were not afraid of bishop's
soldiers, nor did their service have to be conducted secretly. They, however,
had a battle yet to fight, and in the Church of England today there were
alarming symptoms. <font color="#800080"> It was no use shutting our eyes to facts, for Oxford and
Cambridge were sending Jesuits to fill Protestant pulpits as fast as they could.
We had in our so-called Protestant churches Jesuits who preached the doctrines
of Rome unblushingly, who placed the cross behind the crucifix, the Bible behind
truths, and the mercy seat behind the confession, and who did all they could to
bring back Romanism. </font> Such was the bulwark of Protestantism. But there was a free
church, and in it were men and women who would stand up for the Bible, and form
a bulwark against Romanism. The Free Church of England would keep the light
shining in our sea-girt isle, and would be in years to come as in years gone by.
The countries where Romanism had been tolerated for years were throwing off the
yoke. Austria repudiated its authority, Italy was becoming increasingly
Protestant, and in Rome they even had a Baptist chapel; but to Great Britain
those abominations were returning against which our fathers fought. By God's
help, however, they intended to lift up the blood-stained banner, and would cry,
&quot;No priest but the great High Priest, and Christ alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Gange then encouraged the congregation for future work, and concluded by
expressing a wish that Mr. Mills might have a full chapel, a pious church, and a
baptistry continually employed.<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO"> </font>The
Rev. T. Marriott then spoke, succeeded by the Rev. G. Jarman, who delivered a
very congratulatory address.<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO"> </font>Mr,
Westley thanked the friends of the neighbourhood for attending.<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO">
</font>Thanks were also accorded to the Chairman and Mr. Gange.<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO">
</font>The meeting concluded, and those of the audience who had attended from a
distance were hospitably entertained.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp; The inference here is that the large plot of land between Pond Bank
Leys and the top of what is now Chapel Lane was originally <i>owned</i> by Campion rather than rented to
him by Grafton.</p>
