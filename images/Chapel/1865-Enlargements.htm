</font><font size="4">the Baptists carried out
various building works including the building of a manse.&nbsp; They celebrated the laying of a foundation
stone on 18th May, 1865&nbsp;at the corner of that manse and gave an account of the project to the
press.&nbsp; The second part of this article is that account whilst the first
part is composed of selected extracts from the specification to the architects
for the building project. </font><font size="3">(courtesy of Mr. &amp; Mrs. P. Penn)</font><font size="4">.&nbsp;
In 1871 another building phase saw the enlargement of the chapel to its present
size and the construction of the new school room - according to the Baptists'
church book.</font></font></p>

[<i>Clearly, both phases of the building works in 1865 and 1871 were anticipated
in this original specification</i>]</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Generally</b><br>
The contractor is to take down the cottage, outbuildings and boundary walls now
occupying the site, to clean and stack the stone, bricks, and other materials
which if sound and suitable may be used again.&nbsp; Grub up any old foundations
and fill in solid any old cesspools that may be found.<br>
Take up, clean and stack the brick paving now laid in Yard and in front of the
Chapel and relay the same at completion of work.&nbsp; The school room is to be
erected and finished sufficient for occupation before the Chapel is
disturbed.&nbsp; The seats are then to be arranged in the school room which is
to be kept in order and for each Sabbath made available for services.&nbsp; A
clear footway is to be provided at the end of each week.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><br>
<img height="381" src="chapel-enlargement.jpg" width="250" align="left">
The new front and sides of the Chapel are to be carried up to the level of the
present eaves before the old roof is disturbed - it is then to be carefully
stripped, rafters and purlins removed, ceiling and cornices cut away.&nbsp;
Brickwork shall be carried up to the new roof height and the main trusses placed
in their right positions.&nbsp; The present gallery is to be taken down and the iron
columns refixed where shown for the replacement gallery.&nbsp; The seats in the
gallery to be removed to the school room.&nbsp; The pulpit is in like manner to

<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Alterations to existing Buildings</b><br>
The present School room is to be divided by a lath and plaster partition formed

any repairs that may be necessary to existing buildings - clean gutters - look
to roof and replace defective slating and leaving all in a sound and prefect
condition.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080">[there followed detailed work-practice notes for
excavators,&nbsp; bricklayers, mason, slater, carpenter, joiner and ironmonger,
founder and smith, plasterer and finally painter.&nbsp; The notes are <i> very</i>
detailed and often deal with how individual components of the build should be
made or installed.&nbsp; The document then stipulates what is expected of the
contractor should he encounter any problems especially a work force not
available or having striked and that an independent surveyor should be called to
mediate in an intractable disagreement between architect and contractor]</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#000080"><b>LAYING A MEMORIAL STONE AT BLISWORTH </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>A memorial stone</b>, to commemorate the erection of
a vestry, schoolrooms, minister's
residence, enlargement of the burial ground, and other extensions of the Baptist Chapel property in this village, was laid on Thursday
last, by the. Rev. J. T. Brown, in the presence of a goodly number of' spectators.
The memorial stone is at the right hand corner in front of the house which is to
be erected for the esteemed pastor of the chapel, the Rev. G. Bailey, and underneath
the stone was placed a bottle, which contained, amongst other things, a statement
as to the alterations and improvements which had been effected, and a description of the
buildings about to be erected. A copy of this statement will be found below, and,
therefore, we need not now allude to what has been done, and what still remains to do. We might
remark that the cost of the buildings and
enlargements is estimated at £800. Towards this sum, before the laying of the stone there was in the
treasurer's hands £172, and there were promises of donations which would bring the total
amount to £500.
The proceedings were commenced shortly before three
o'clock in the afternoon by a hymn being sung,
after which the Rev. J. P. Haddy read the 32nd Psalm, and then the Rev. T.
Marriott offered an appropriate prayer. The Psalm &quot;Lift up your heads, Oh ye gates&quot; was afterwards sung, and then the Rev. G. Bailey read
a copy of the statement which had been put in the bottle. Some mortar was now spread beneath the stone by the Rev.
J. T. Brown, and the stone having been placed in
its proper position, the rev. gentleman gave it a few taps with a mallet, and then said, &quot;' I. pronounce this stone as surely and well
laid as any amateur
mason could lay it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">[</font><i><font color="#800080">The stone can <u>not</u> be seen these days because
of garden and outbuilding changes</font></i><font color="#000080">]</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The following is a copy of the statement which was put into the bottle,
and which was read by the pastor of the Chapel:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>&quot;This statement is written to inform those who are yet
unborn, who may be our successors in furtherance of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ, in connexion with this Baptist Church, and sheweth that Edward Campion,
William Woodhouse, Joseph Marriott, Joseph Westley, John Tite<font FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="KO">
</font>Cave, John Campion, William Lepper, Robert Campion Westley, and George
Griggs Bailey were chosen in public meeting convened in the Baptist Chapel, to
be and act in committee, with authority to purchase a portion of the garden
adjoining the chapel and burial ground so generously offered by, the aforesaid
Edward Campion, and therewith to enlarge the burial ground, and to build thereon
a vestry, schoolroom, and minister's residence,
with convenient offices attached, according to the plans and drawings exhibited and
approved by the said meeting. Also, to repair and re-seat the chapel, enclose the
property entire, and put the whole in trust by a
new deed as soon as it is possible.<br>
&quot;Accordingly,
the said committee commenced the work assigned them
in the first week in January, one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-five, by removing
the offensive offices in front of the chapel, and re-building them behind the three
adjacent cottages, one to each separate occupier.
They enlarged the burial-ground from the brook below northward up to the vestry and
schoolroom, by taking in from the garden an average breadth of fifteen feet
throughout the whole length. From the hill facing the highroad they carted nearly
two thousand tons of earth down to the lowest and farthest end of the present enlarged burial ground, and
raised it from ten to twelve feet, and enclosed it all round with strong, substantial
walls of stone and brick. They enclosed the ground in front of the chapel with side
walls of brickwork, and erected a strong and handsome iron
fence in front, supported at
each end with stone piers. They laid a central
path of bricks from the gates to the chapel doors,
laid the sides with
grassplats and planted on them memorial trees, the walls of the vestry and schoolroom
being built up as high as the ceiling, thirty poles of
garden ground being newly appropriated to the chapel property, and the foundation
of the house for the use of the minister
being laid.<br>
&quot;Now, on this 18th day of May, in the year
1865, about three o'clock
in the afternoon, we lay
this bottle in the foundation at the right hand corner in front of the
minister's residence. It contains a copy of the Freeman newspaper of this date, a
handbill calling this meeting, and, by request, the pastor's manuscript;
a sample of wheat of Mr. John Tite Cave; a sample of kidney beans and cucumber
seeds, by Joseph Westley; a sample of field beans by John Campion; a piece of a
ox's hoof, a heirloom of 60 years, by Mr William Lepper; and in honour of our
beloved Queen Victoria, the widow's two half-farthings and two new farthings by
Edward Campion, and a silver shilling by Joseph Westley.<br>
&quot;The cost of these
buildings and enlargements is estimated at £800 when completed.&nbsp; The
amount in the treasurer's hands towards removal of that debt is £472, with
promises, sure and good, reaching £500.&nbsp; Now the bottle is deposited, the
Rev. J. T. Brown, the beloved pastor of the Baptist Church in College Street
(Northampton), will lay the memorial corner stone in the front of the house, on
the right hand corner, and when laid, and the house built thereon, may the hand
of violence never disturb it and may the house be occupied godly pastors through
many generations.&quot;</i><br>
Signed by the committee - George G. Bailey, chairman;
Joseph Westley, superintendent of the works, John Tite Cave, treasurer, John
Campion, secretary, William Lepper, Joseph Marriott, Edward Campion, and William
Woodhouse.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>The stone having been laid</b>, the Rev. J. T. Brown
commenced an address by remarking that they must all feel that the present was a
most interesting occasion, and one by no means of an ordinary character.&nbsp;
It was full of interest, not only to the friends at Blisworth, but to those who
lived round about them, and who were sympathetic with them for the great objects
for which they were living.&nbsp; Having perhaps wept with them in days gone by
when they wept, they had come there that afternoon to rejoice with them in their
joy.&nbsp; He supposed there was not any one present, certainly not any one
of&nbsp; ... and reflective mind, but must feel that this was a very pleasant
occasion, not only on account of the nature of the occasion when viewed by
itself, but likewise what it reminded them of.&nbsp; It brought back the
past; it told them of the work that had been done in the ages that were gone,
and of which their present exertions were only the manifestation and the
fruit.&nbsp; [</font><i><font color="#800080">rather recursive sermon not given
here in full . . . </font></i><font color="#000080">] There were not wanting
clouds on the horizon, there were not wanting signs that the times of trial are
coming. The old hostility which tried to put down Nonconformity at first is not
dead. It tried to destroy the young child's life; and now, with unwise but with
cruel hand, it would attempt to destroy the man's life. It would <i>not </i>succeed,
although the effort may cost Nonconformists much. The friends in the villages
know what he meant—(hear, hear)—they knew the kind of thing that was rising
against them, and should prepare themselves, if needs be for the day of trial.
Those who sat in the chapels which their fathers built should be like their
fathers in their steadfast manliness and patient courage. What did it matter—a
Dissenter, despised and looked down upon, having a few evils to hear? He would
soon lie down in the grave, over which the grass and the daisies will grow, and
the lark will sing her song. It would be nothing to him then, any more than the
wind of yesterday, that men despised him for his fidelity, but it would be of
infinite consequence that he was true to truth, true to himself, and true to the
Lord. Angels shall sing over the grave of such a man, and shall say
&quot;Faithful unto death; blessed are the dead so faithful.''&nbsp; The rev.
gentleman concluded by expressing the pleasure which it had given him to take
part in the proceedings, and he trusted that the work which they had commenced
would result in blessings to their children and their children's children. A
plate was then placed on the memorial stone, and as those present passed by they
placed in it their donations, and by this means £4 were raised. A public tea
afterwards took place in the chapel, the trays being given by the ladies of the
congregation, and the tea was partaken of by about 300 persons. The evening
meeting took place in the Chapel at six o'clock, the chair being occupied by the
Rev. J. T. Brown. There was a very large attendance. Amongst the ministers who
were present at the meeting or at the laying of the stone were the Rev. J.
Nickalls and the Rev. Joseph Brown, Northampton; the Rev. Thomas Harriott,
Milton; the Rev. J. Lea, Moulton; the Rev. T. Chamberlain, Pattishall; the Rev.
Amos Smith, Harpole; the Rev. J. C. Robinson, Brington; the Rev. G. Bailey,
Blisworth; the Rev. H. Hardin, Towcester; the Rev. J. P. Haddv, Ravensthorpe;</font>
<font color="#000080">Rev. H. Capern, Bugbrooke, &amp;c. The meeting was opened
with a prayer by the Rev. H. Capern, after which Mr. Joseph Westley, of
Blisworth, alluded to the fact that the work which they had now in hand had been
in contemplation for some years, and that it was entirely owing to the kindness
of Mr. Edward Campion that they had been enabled to do what they had, as he had
placed the land which they required at their disposal, desiring that it should
be valued by Mr. Bearn when their alterations were completed; and his son, Mr.
John Campion, has kindly offered to pay for the land. The other speakers were
the Rev. Thomas Marriott, the Rev. Thomas Chamberlain, the Rev. T. Lea, Mr.
Bearn of Finedon ; the Rev. J. P. Haddy, the Rev. Joseph Brown, the Rev. J.
Nickalls, the Rev. Amos Smith, and the Rev. H. Hardin. The amount collected
during the day was £33 5s 0d.<br>
In consequence of the late period of the week at which the meeting was held we
have been necessarily obliged to curtail our report. Another tea meeting was
held yesterday afternoon, when it was expected that the collection would amount
to £50.</font></p>
