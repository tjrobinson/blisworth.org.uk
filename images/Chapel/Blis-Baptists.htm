<p class="MsoBodyText"><font color="#000080">In the new year of 1826, had he wished, the Right
Reverend Lord Bishop of Peterborough could have read a list of buildings
certificated for use as places of worship for protestant non-conformists. Each
year the Clerk of the Peace, administrator for the Justices of the Peace who met
four times a year to run Northamptonshire’s affairs, supplied the Church of
England authorities with information on the “opposition”. In the list he
could have read of;<span style="font-family:Arial">

</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The group who had applied for the license for the new
Meeting House, now the Baptist Church, certainly included eminently respectable
men – and, probably women. They had come a long way and in the years that
followed were to go much further.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet
building a chapel was neither the beginning nor the end of the story.</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font color="#000080">Events in Blisworth were not unique: Northamptonshire
must have been, in the view of the Lord Bishop of Peterborough, something of a
worry. The county was a major centre of the Baptist movement in particular, and
of non-conformity in general. Though the men who had applied for the license
were thoroughly respectable, they must have appeared to the authorities as being
amongst a growing number of people who were unwilling to accept the established
Church. In Blisworth the Baptist congregation had been growing rapidly. This
mattered because Church and State were seen as mutually supportive bastions
against the sort of revolutionary activity that had torn Europe and was
perceived as a threat to the ruling classes in Britain.</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">There were many other non-conformist Meeting Houses
licensed during this period, indeed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>between
1784 and 1789 there were four licenses granted for different buildings in
Blisworth alone. A further five buildings in the village were licensed between
1825 and 1851. (NRO QS 292/1-9) Nor were these the first. The notion of a
Meeting House is important in understanding the early history of Baptists. To
focus purely on a building when writing the history of a group of people is
always too narrow. The Anglican Church of St. John the Baptist had stood on its
mound, dominating the village in tandem with the manor for many years. The
Church of England and those who adhered to it had official status and an
appropriately grand building to reflect that. Non-conformists did not have this
official sanction of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>their
existence: hence the notion of a Meeting rather than a Church. The Baptist
meetings in dwelling houses were originally just that. Purpose built Meeting
Houses were the exception rather than the rule in the early years of
non-conformity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Non-conformists, numerous in some parishes, few in
number in others, sought out people of similar mind and invited preachers
“mighty in the scriptures” and gifted in preaching to visit. It has been
estimated that Baptists in Weston by Weedon, to the south-west of Blisworth,
met, as a matter of course, up to twelve miles distant from the village. (VCH
Northants. Vol II 1906) Between 1737 and 1825, the nearest purpose built Baptist
Meeting House to Blisworth was at Roade although there were dwelling-houses and
a barn licensed as Meeting Houses in the village itself. The use of a stream at
Hyde Farm for baptism and the presence of Blisworth folk amongst the membership
of the Roade Church, make it clear that that the focus of Blisworth Baptists in
the late eighteenth century was Roade, though the powerful influence of John
Ryland and his son at College Street at Northampton must have been felt. There
are no child dedications from 1780<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to
1825 in the records of Towcester Baptist Church for children from Blisworth.
However, children from Tiffield, Stoke Bruerne and Greens Norton seem to have
been dedicated there. (NRO Non-Conformist Registers)&nbsp; From the 18th century
Northampton was notable in having an educational academy for future
non-conformist ministers, though unlikely to include Baptists.&nbsp; This
academy was set up on Castle Hill, only 300 yards from College Street, by <a href="Doddridge.pdf"> Philip
Doddridge</a> who was a key to the development of Northampton also in other
ways.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">By the end of the eighteenth century, it seems that the
growth in the number of Baptists was being matched by an increasing degree of
geographical stability. This is logical. The Church of England was always there:
to have a Non-Conformist Meeting, people with commitment were needed – money
helped, too. Until there were enough people to support an independent Meeting
the reliance of Blisworth Baptists on Roade would continue. The idea of a
Meeting is also important because Non-Conformists not only held Sunday Service,
but added Prayer Meetings, Bible Study, Sunday School, Lectures and Sermons from
visiting preachers. Some meetings took place on Sunday, but other times would
have been used, too. The number of licensed buildings in Blisworth may reflect
both growing numbers and diversity of use.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">It could also reflect splits amongst the Baptists
(though there is little evidence of this in Blisworth), who, along with other
Non-Conformists, were notorious for arguing about aspects of doctrine and
practice. Before the late eighteenth century lack of official status, mobility
and, especially in the late seventeenth century, difficulties in differentiating
between Non-Conformists, add to the problems of shortage of records when trying
to recover the early history of Dissenters. However, the Blisworth Baptists of
1784, Robert Campion, Thomas Clark, Richard Dent, William Faulkner, John
Goodridge, Joseph Wills and Thomas Wills, who risked official disapproval by
licensing their houses and barns, were not the first villagers to do so.</font></p>

“That there are great multitudes of Anabaptists and Quakers that assemble
themselves together in great Numbers (sic) to the endangering of the peace of
the County of Northamptonshire; and that scatter abroad seditious papers against
the Ministry.” (House of Lords Journal A1660 12 Car. II)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The religious toleration promised by Charles II on his
restoration in 1660 was not shared by either the Lords or Commons of the
Cavalier Parliament, which set about taking revenge on the religious and
political radicals they blamed for the outbreak of the Civil War and the
overthrow of proper government and the ordained social order.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>“Anabaptists”
was a term of abuse. Literally meaning “Re-Baptizer”, it was associated with
supposed atrocities committed by Thomas Munzer and his followers in Germany in
the 1530s. In England laws had been passed against it in 1525 and 1534. However
in the heat of religious debate of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries
Baptist Meetings were founded in England. By 1633 they had even managed to split
into General and Particular Baptists. They were not the only people with ideas
that challenged the established Church of England. Indeed the Church of England
was full of dissenting opinion. The outbreak of the Civil War and the execution
of Charles I set loose a host of radical political and religious ideas –
usually closely entwined. Independents, Baptists, Quakers, Shakers, Ranters,
Fifth Monarchists argued and raged, waxed and waned. The Bible was their guide
and in it they sought authority for Church organisation, doctrine and practice.
Apparently arrogant because of a perceived certainty that they were right, these
groups were in fact open to correction based upon scripture. There was a sect
called the Seekers, which seems a good description for them all: they sought
truth, as they found it in scripture. The reason for making much of this is that
in the late seventeenth century the person willing to challenge established
orthodoxy was liable to be,</font></p>

church in 1644 and then by turns a Presbyterian, an Independent, a Baptist, a
Seeker and, before the restoration of Charles II in 1660, a Quaker. (BR White,
The English Baptists of the Seventeenth Century, 1996, Pg 26.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">John Staughton was christened in Blisworth parish church
on November 20th, 1636. His father, also John, and mother, Mary, soon produced a
second child, William, christened on October 21<sup>st</sup>, 1638. William’s
daughter, Patience, was christened in 1663. John Staughton died in 1716,
following his wife, Elizabeth who had died in 1711. There was also another John
Staughton who died in 1699; he may have been a son of John son of John! (NRO
Blisworth Parish Records: Extract of Christenings, Marriages and Burials)</O:P>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Until the mid-seventeenth century there were few
Separatists who had split away from the Church of England. Many divergent views
existed within the established Church. However, there was little chance that the
radical forces could be contained after the Civil War. Indeed the Parliament of
1660 was determined to destroy radical religious ideas that they saw as a threat
to the stability of society. There is some debate about the extent to which
Baptists were involved in radical politics. Most would probably have been happy
with a more tolerant state, however some had been active republicans. It is easy
to understand how the authorities perceived the Baptist movement as a whole as a
direct threat.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Thus the House of Lords voiced its concerns about
Anabaptists in Northamptonshire. Supported by the Commons, they ordered,</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:73.3pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:81.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font color="#000080">That it is recommended to the
Justices of the next Assize of that county, to give special Charges and
Directions to the Justices of the Peace, and other officers, to take care to
suppress and prevent such Meetings; and that the Sheriff of the County do take
special care to prevent riotous Meetings and preserve the peace of the County.
(House of Lords Journal A 1660 12 Car. II)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Unsurprisingly the Baptists responded. Morley and
Francis of Ravensthorpe, leading Baptists in Northamptonshire were amongst other
Baptist “messengers” who met in London in 1660 to produce a defence of
Baptism. Amongst their “able assistants” appears one John Stauton (sic) of
Blissworth (sic). (Antiquarian Memoranda and Biographies, ed. J Taylor, 1901)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Staughton fell foul of the law in the era of persecution
ushered in by the Act of Uniformity. This law required all parish priests to
accept all aspects of Church of England doctrine and rites. Priests who refused
were expelled. In Northamptonshire some 46 refused to conform. (RL Greenall, A
History of Northamptonshire, 2000, Pg 86). Thus Dissent or Non-Conformity was
defined as dissent from the Church of England and non-conformity with its
practices. This was a period of real persecution. John Staughton, along with
John Grundon of Cocket (possibly Caldecote), lost possessions and cattle and was
imprisoned in 1685 or 1686. He had, already, been excommunicated for forty days
and publicly denounced in 1682, along with men from other villages (NRO
Proceedings of the Consistory Court of the Diocese of Peterborough). That was
the price of Non-Conformity. He was released shortly after the Act of Toleration
was passed in 1689. (Antiquarian Memoranda and Biographies, ed. J Taylor, 1901)
This did not remove all penalties against Non-Conformists, but ushered in a
period or relative official toleration matched by continued exclusion from many
aspects of life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">It is quite possible that a John Staulton of Blisworth,
who married Ellenor Manning in 1696 and died in 1699 was a son of John Staughton,
born in 1636, who licensed his house in 1701 as a place of worship. It is
equally possible that he was the preacher who was imprisoned. Perhaps more
evidence will clarify this issue. This does not affect the reality of the
burdens under which Non-Conformists suffered. What is notable is that there was
clearly a growing Baptists presence. Elizabeth Staughton (died 1728), a daughter
of John Staughton, which one is unclear, married William Stanger, who was
“much esteemed as a Baptist minister”. (R H Stanger: A Stanger Family
Memoir, Otford, 1986). Their children were all christened in Blisworth and two
were buried there. The second notable point can be drawn from the records of the
Archdeaconry Court for Northampton. This court dealt with probate of wills and
administration where no written will existed. In four grants between 1692 and
1699, the two John Staughtons (sometimes possibly mis-transcribed as Stanton or
just written incorrectly by the clerk) were either giving surety for the
executor, taking inventories or acting as executors. On two occasions these were
on the death of family members, but it seems that they were trusted individuals
amongst other local Baptists. Other names in these grants, such as Plowman, are
often found in later records relating to Baptists in Blisworth, indicating a
social and religious network developing both in the village and in the
surrounding area. A further indication of the connections formed by Blisworth
Baptists is the part played by William Staughton, son of John (1636-1716), and
his wife, Anne, in the founding of the Baptist Church in Long Buckby. William
and his brother Thomas worked as woolcombers in Long Buckby.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Interestingly, amongst the Archdeaconry Court records
mentioned above the name Thomas Dingley, at one time a Churchwarden of Blisworth
Church, appears alongside those of identifiable Baptists. Perhaps this indicates
that divisions were not so deep as may be assumed. However, it may be that
Thomas Dingley had some special interest in this particular estate.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The key point for the development of Baptism in
Blisworth that can be drawn from the genealogy of the Staughton family, however
it fits together, is that Staughtons and Stangers provided Blisworth with
notable Baptist preachers into the first half of the eighteenth century.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a <a href="staughtontree.htm">partial family tree</a>
for the Staughtons researched with the help of S. Edwards with footnotes which
illustrate that, down the generations, there were many non-conformists in both
England, the Stanger family, and the USA, the Staughton family, springing from
John Staughton.</O:P>
&nbsp; The
hazy memory of the gospel being preached recorded by John Goodridge in the
eighteen-twenties had become so in rather less than fifty years.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">During twentieth century redecoration at Elm Tree
Cottage, Blisworth, some writing was revealed over one of the fireplaces. The
house was built some time in the 1630s and the writing matched that date, or one
slightly later. It read,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:73.3pt;margin-bottom:

16.0pt;font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">“teach me to doe thy will for thou art my god; let
thy good spirit leade mee into the land of the righteousness.” (sic)<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3"><font color="#000080">This is verse ten of Psalm 143, though not exactly the
same as in the King James Bible. Whilst it has no special significance for
Baptists today and might be used by any Christian facing oppression or at a fork
in their spiritual road, it certainly rings true of the hardship faced by people
such as Staughton. From the rent rolls of the Grafton Estate we know that the
Staughton or, in this case, “Stalton” family were tenant farmers. Land
holding does not rule out other occupations. There is no historical evidence to
link Elm Tree Cottage to John Staughton. Yet, to be over imaginative and
somewhat sentimental, it would be pleasing to think that a Psalm on the wall of
one of the beautiful ironstone houses of which Blisworth has so many, puts us
directly in touch with a man who stood against, what he saw, as oppression. <a name="Stalton"></a> A
stronger case can probably be made for the Staughtons, who were bakers as well
as yeomen, holding the old bakehouse at what is now 38 High Street. <a href="Blis-Baptists.htm#1">[1]</a>&nbsp;
This was
certainly the case in 1727. It is not impossible for both properties to have
been occupied by Staughtons at some time in the past: two John Staltons (sic.)
paid the 1674 Hearth Tax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">It is hard to estimate the number of Baptists in the
seventeenth century. The “Compton Census”, taken by Archbishop Compton in
1676 at the behest of Danby, Charles II’s chief minister of the time, gives
some indication of the total of Non-Conformists. Even if one takes into account
that Danby hoped to persuade Charles II that the Dissenters were not so great a
threat as they had been made out to be, a general idea of numbers can be
obtained. The figures are often too comfortably rounded to ring true but there
seems little reason to doubt the general gist.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">With the exception of Bugbrooke and Tiffield, between
one in ten and one in thirty people were described as Non-Conformists. How many
of these were Baptists is unclear. It is safe to conclude only that the number
was small. However, quantity was counteracted by quality. The expelled Church of
England ministers were often amongst the most energetic and active, whilst lay
Non-Conformists were highly committed or they would not have willingly faced
persecution and exclusion. It is generally accepted that Dissenters at this time
were typically the middling sort of artisan or yeoman farmer, rather than the
landowner or the labourer.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080"><img height="292" src="staughton-entry-sm.jpg" width="550" align="left">
 Thus, in 1701, John Staughton, maybe the same one who
had suffered imprisonment for his beliefs, “did certify his dwelling house”
as a place of Non-Conformist worship: his trade, baker. (NRO QS292/1 page 6.)
That the Staughtons were of the middling sort in the village is confirmed by the
Hearth Tax returns of 1662. Most of the villagers were exempt but, of the
taxpayers, the rector had five hearths, a few had two, whilst the majority,
including John Stoughton (sic) had just one. By 1674, one John Staughton was
liable for three hearths and another John Staughton for two. However, it is
certain that he was in a tiny minority. Perhaps it did not matter so much by
that time. It would have been hard for a village baker to follow his trade faced
with disapproval of landowners, farmers and miller, let alone his customers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">There are no records of licenses for Non-Conformist
worship in Northamptonshire from 1708 to 1736. The next existent certification
for a building in Blisworth dates from 1752. One Richard Clarke obtained a
license, but there are no biographical details in the entry. (NRO QS 292/1 page
40) There is no indication of Richard Clarke’s denomination, though thirty
years later, Thomas Clark, possibly a relative, was one of the men who applied
for licenses in 1784, as Baptism began to blossom in the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The words above are those of John Goodridge. From 1780
until 1828 he was the leading figure amongst the Baptists of Blisworth. Clearly
a highly respected figure – at least to other Dissenters - during his life,
his short account of the growth of Baptism in Blisworth <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Chapel/download.php?filename=Early%20account.pdf"> written in the Church
Book</a> shortly before his death rings true. (NRO Bl B 7)<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">In this account he explains how he came to Blisworth
from Hartwell, where the Goodridges were tenant farmers on the Duke of
Grafton’s estate. Having married Ann Blunt, he took a farm tenancy from the
Duke of Grafton in Blisworth in 1780. He became a member of the Roade Baptist
Church in 1782. He was certainly a Dissenter before this date – membership of
a Baptist Meeting meant adult baptism following a profession of faith and of
religious experience. He remarks that in Blisworth he found “three or four in
the village” of like-mind and so they met together for prayer and
“encouragement”. The small numbers of Dissenters in the village is clear.
Interestingly, Goodridge points out that,</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:73.3pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:81.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font color="#000080">The Gospel had been preached in
the village some years before, but how long could not be ascertained.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Memory of Dissent in the village was present, but
apparently vague. There was no Dissenting minister. Although John Goodridge did
not technically bring Baptism to Blisworth, it was in a pretty poor state when
he arrived.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Unless the “three or four” were also newcomers to
the village, it can be assumed that it was Goodridge who motivated them into
action. Richard Dent was almost certainly one of the few, and he was a resident
- the Blisworth miller who eventually gave way to the Westleys. Robert Campion
was a tenant farmer and became a prominent figure in the Roade Church. Of the
others who signed the letter of application for the 1784 license, little has
emerged, so far.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Meeting at one another’s houses, at first – in
defiance of the law – they eventually applied for a license in 1784. The
“house with the appurtenances”, occupied by William Faulkner, was
“certified” as a “place of religious worship for Protestant Dissenters”
on July 15<sup>th</sup> 1784. The applicants were, in order of signature on the
letter of application;</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The “three or four” had already become six – at
least.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The granting of this license was far from a formality.
Neighbouring ministers were now invited to preach on Sunday evenings and the
nascent Meeting could act more openly. Goodridge himself may possibly have
preached, although he makes no mention of this in his account. In any case he
was a member of the Roade Church and would probably have attended services there
– as may others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The Rector of Blisworth, Rev. Trotter, was, naturally,
concerned at the growth, albeit small, of Dissent in his parish. Goodridge
recounts a summons to meet the Rector, who “swore to leave no stone
unturned” to destroy them when his demands were defied. Failing to browbeat
them into submission, the Rev. Trotter, aided by the Duke of Grafton’s
steward, John Roper, succeeded in having their license revoked. Although they
were now acting illegally because the premises were not licensed, they carried
on as before – presumably meeting surreptitiously in each other’s houses.
The steward, according to Goodridge, described their meetings as a “conventicle”.
This harked back to a long repealed law of 1664 which made it illegal for any
group of more than four, except for families, to meet for non-conformist
worship. At that time “conventicle” smacked of sedition. More than a hundred
years after its repeal it seems that some still saw Baptists in that light or
found it a useful tool to persuade the authorities to act against them. However,
it should not be assumed that Trotter and Roper were unusually oppressive or
vehement in their attempts to stifle the growth of Non-Conformity. This was the
attitude of many in the Anglican Church and the land-owning class that held
power in the country – especially at local level. It would be more surprising
had they not reacted in this way.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Goodridge described this as a period of
“persecution”. Despite this it was not so drastic as the persecution of John
Staughton over a century before, nor did it seem to prevent the number of
Baptists growing. They started to use “Whites Barn”, a barn rented by Robert
Campion – another of the Grafton tenant farmers. The date at which this began
has been given as 1787. (Tony Marsh, Blisworth, 2004, Pg 9) It is quite possible
that this is accurate, although the barn was not licensed until October 1789. (NRO
QS 292/3) Goodridge also gives 1789 as the year in which the Duke of Grafton,
after intervention by Mr. Goode, the Independent Minister at Potterspury,
sanctioned the use of this barn, dismissing the counter arguments of his steward
and the rector. (NRO Bl B 7) Perhaps Goodridge decided that an official version
was best and dated use from the year of official sanction, though it is hard to
imagine that he would shy away from the truth. However, “use” and
“license” could be very different things.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Goodridge was sure that the Duke of Grafton had not
known of the “persecution”. Tradition has it that the Duke remarked that
“They shall have their Meeting House: they are some of my best tenants.”
(Notes by Maureen Smith). The Third Duke of Grafton
(1735-1811) had been Chief Minister to George III for a short period and seems
to have been too honest or trusting for politics. Returning to his estates in
1783 he maintained an interest in hunting and women, whilst becoming a keen
agricultural reformer and advocate of the new canal. If he did not make that
remark about the Baptists, he should have done. A similar statement has been
attributed to the fourth Duke regarding the refusal of his steward to help with
stone for the Meeting House in 1825. (Tony Marsh, Blisworth, 2004, Pg 9)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Interestingly Goodridge describes the period 1780 to 1789 as one of
persecution for Baptists and does not refer to 1825 as such. (NRO Bl B 7) An
anonymous manuscript history written in 1900 adds to the story though does not
refer to the source of the information. This manuscript is based largely on
Goodridge’s account, but goes beyond it by stating that the Baptists actively
sought out Mr. Goode to “lay their case before the Duke” and that the Duke
came to Blisworth to hear the issue and sort the problem out. This refers to
1787-9. Clearly in 1900 the memory was the Duke found out that Campion and
Goodridge were amongst the leading Baptists he declared, “Well Trotter, why
can’t you let these people alone? They are some of my best tenants. They shall
have a meeting house”: meaning the use of a barn (NRO BlB3. This would seem to
be conclusive regarding the Duke’s ignorance of persecution.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Half the barn was fitted out as a place of worship and,
once the license was obtained an opening ceremony was held. Appropriately, Mr.
Goode – the Independent Minister who had informed the Duke – preached, as
did the Rev. John Ryland, pastor of the College Street Baptist Church in
Northampton. Ryland was one of the leading figures in eighteenth century
Baptism. The image of him preaching in a barn in Blisworth is a resounding
explanation of the success of Dissent. Ryland was also an advocate of an
evangelical approach: allowing an Independent to preach to a Baptist Meeting was
quite acceptable.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Use of a barn was a big step forward. April and July
1789 had seen licenses granted for the houses occupied by Robert Campion and
John Goodridge to be used for worship, but it seems these were inadequate. The
Baptists now had favourable conditions for growth; a landlord who looked on them
with favour – or, at least, was indifferent to Dissent amongst tenants who
made up a profitable part of his rent roll -, strong and enthusiastic leadership
and an established Baptist Church at Roade to support the new Meeting. Even the
opposition of the Anglican party in the village was reduced by the Duke of
Grafton’s moderate attitude and, between 1797 and 1839, the frequent absence
of leadership. The <a href="../Articles/Ambrosse-2.htm"> Rev. Ambrose, Rector of Blisworth</a> was apparently dishonest,
absent or in the bankruptcy courts. This could hardly have acted as a
recommendation for Anglicanism. (Tony Marsh, Blisworth, 2004, Pg 9 and <a href="../BBook/BBook.html"> on
this site</a>)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Initially the Rev. Heighton, of Roade, preached to the
Blisworth Meeting in their barn on one Sunday evening each month. However, he
was soon preaching on three Sunday evenings a month: eventually this became
four. The less formal nature of the singing and prayers may well have been an
attraction; perhaps the sermons hit the spot; it could have been the obviously
enthusiastic leadership; whatever the motivation, the congregation grew rapidly.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080"><a name="first"></a>In 1807 a Sabbath or Sunday School was set up. Goodridge
notes, with delight, that six or seven children in the first few days soon
became fifty or sixty regular attenders. Even better, he enthused that some
“showed signs of conversion”. Meanwhile several adults literally took the
plunge to become full members of the Church at Roade. By this time the whole of
the barn was in use for worship and, though it “grieved us very much”,
Goodridge explains how most of the children had to be dismissed before
“publick (sic) worship” began to ensure there was sufficient space for the
congregation. (NRO Bl B 7)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The inevitable logic was that a new Meeting House was
needed in Blisworth. This was built, with fixed desks for the hundred strong
Sabbath School. Shortly after this Goodridge and others from Blisworth asked for
“dismission” from the Church at Roade to constitute their own Church in
Blisworth. The letter requesting this was signed by;</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">These were the first members of Blisworth Baptist.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oddly,
Elizabeth Church is not listed in the records of the Church membership, though
she subscribed £2 to the building of the Church in 1825 and had, presumably
been a member at Roade – how else could she asked to receive dismission? It
is, therefore, likely that this is an error in record keeping. By the time John
Goodridge died in 1828 there were twenty-four members. The congregation –
those attending Meetings – would have been larger. A list of those who
subscribed money towards the building of the Meeting House reveals the range of
status and wealth as well as the names of members of the Congregation or
sympathisers. Some of these may have remained members of Roade Church. In the
notebook in which the names are listed (NRO BlB5) all are sectioned off with a
marginal note: Blisworth.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The list is headed by tenant farmers of the Grafton
Estate (John Goodridge snr, Cornelius Gudgeon, Robert Campion, William Lepper,
William Pettifer, for example) and tradesmen (Westley was a baker and miller,
Church was a shopkeeper and Johnson probably a builder or craftsman of some
kind.) Yet, the striking thing about the list is its length. A very rough
estimate would suggest around thirty families or parts of families are
represented, possibly more. The 1821 Census describes Blisworth as having some
147 separate families. True, the Baptists were a minority, but if one takes into
account some Baptists who may not have been able to give and others in the
village with little religious conviction, they were a sizeable minority.
Moreover, they were strongly represented in the middle rank of society. In a
village where there was no resident landowner that was of some importance.</font></p>

Goodrige was not technically the first Baptist in Blisworth, nor did he strictly
speaking bring Baptism to the village alone. Yet his years in Blisworth
correspond with a quite spectacular improvement in the fortunes of Dissenters.
Literate, experienced, trusted, respected, clearly a man of drive and enthusiasm
– a man with a gift – he died Deacon of a Church where nearly half a century
before had been but “three or four” people. That he was the one asked,
shortly before his death, to write a memoir of the early stages of the
establishment of Baptism in the village is evidence enough that John Goodridge
was regarded as a guiding light: he also put his money where his mouth was.
Moreover, the fact that he had been able to purchase a small piece of land,
Little Ease, in Mill Lane, where the new Meeting House was built, did much to
ease the foundation of a Baptist Church in the village.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Of course, there were others. Their names are there in
the documents, but we know little more about their role in the rise of Baptism
in Blisworth. John Goodridge, William Goodridge and Robert Campion had all been
members of Roade Baptist Church and trustees of the Meeting House. From 1825
onwards Blisworth is the focus of the records and a more colourful picture of
Dissenting life in the village emerges.</font></p>

</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Commitment to building a Meeting House was no small
thing. There were costs to be borne and a degree of hostility to be faced. For
some Anglicans the sight of Baptists in a barn was bad enough, but a purpose
built base for dissent made from bricks and mortar must have been an affront to
the less tolerant in the Church Party. And bricks and mortar it had to be as
“the proprietor of the quarry refused to sell us stones to build a place of
Worship …. which considerably increased our expense.” (NRO BlB4) No reason
is given for the refusal to let the Baptists have stone. Local lore declares
that it was religious prejudice on behalf of Mr. Roper, the agent for the
Grafton Estate, <a href="../Articles/Stone-works.html">being the manager of the
quarry and the acting 'proprietor'</a>. There seems little reason to doubt this. As the Baptists were
able to meet the extra expense of building in brick, they could certainly have
paid above the market price for stone, whilst Roper’s reputation suggests that
he was not a man to hold back if there was money to be made.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080"><img height="389" src="chapel&#32;1838.jpg" width="400" align="left">
 The land at “Little Ease” was bought from John
Goodridge snr for £10. (NRO BlB7). The anonymous historian of 1900 gives a
picturesque twist to the story, describing how, hard at work, a lad named Job
was told to “stop planting those potatoes, we are going to have a chapel
here.” The building was relatively straight-forward in design and some
thirty-six feet square, with fixed desks for one hundred in the Sunday School. A
small burial ground was included and licensed for use in 1827. This is the
ground at the back of the chapel, overlooking Pond Bank. The total cost, by
1827, was £651- 15s. 5 ½d.&nbsp; A part of the Grafton Survey map of 1838 is
shown here and indicates a square building with two associated houses nearby
(they are also hatched in a darker colour: as elsewhere on the survey eg. the
rectory and school are hatched to match the church).&nbsp; Next to these
associated buildings is shown a barn in the earlier Grafton Survey of 1727 and
that might have been &quot;White's barn&quot;.&nbsp; There is no record
elsewhere in any survey since 1727 of a field or patch called &quot;Little
Ease&quot; <a href="Blis-Baptists.htm#2">[see footnote 2]</a>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Survey records of 1838 show all
the plots (77 - chapel &amp; yard, 78 - garden, 79 &amp; 80 - houses with
gardens) as belonging to John Goodridge (his name given perhaps as a shorthand
for a group of trustees) with two tenants; Henry Lines and Joseph Marriott, in
the houses.&nbsp; The last named appears in the list of contributors to building
costs; both may well have been deacons for the chapel</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">It had initially been hoped to build without public
assistance. A recently built Meeting House at nearby Ashton had been financed
purely by subscription from its members. However, in a larger village and with
greater numbers to cater for it soon became clear that they would be unable to
go it alone. However, building went ahead.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">On completion it was only natural to hold an opening
service. It was held on September 15<sup>th</sup>, 1825. Two sermons in the
morning followed by two in the evening, with tea in between, may not be to the
modern taste, but it does reflect the Dissenters enthusiasm for preaching and
teas. Despite the bad weather, which, according to the Church Book, “prevented
many from attending” an impressive range of preachers from Luton, Olney and
Northampton was lined-up. The bad weather was not just a lame excuse in a period
of poor roads and little waterproof clothing. Even so, the turn out may well
have been quite numerous: the first collection amounted to £49 9s 10d. A rough
equivalent in 2005 would be £1400. Of course, there is every possibility of
extra generosity on this special occasion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The money from this collection was added to the £253
– 9s – 6d already subscribed and sundry gifts from “friends and neighbours”
of £9 1s 7 ½d. There was a debt of over £267 on the building, a debt that was
increased to over £340 by the provision of a burial ground and other
facilities. This was paid off in a number of ways: there was a “Penny-a-week
subscription” for members of the congregation, whilst the wealthier members
forked out considerable sums of money. William Goodridge made a list the leading
donors between 1825 and the paying off of the debt in July 1833.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">(Derived from NRO BlB19)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">This paid off the bulk of the debt. The same people also
loaned money to cover on-going costs during building. Interest was paid on these
loans, which were repaid in instalments (NRO BlB19). One did not have to be
wealthy to be involved in the Church though. William Wood, who subscribed three
pounds was one of those charged with finding ways to pay off the debt as soon as
possible. He gave his energy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>There were
also small gifts from other Baptist Churches that were canvassed and visited,
for example in Northampton, Stoney Stratford, Weston and Moreton Pinkney, Luton,
Grendon, Olney. This also led to expense to support those sent to make an appeal
that did not necessarily end with a letter. Initially, the Pastor, George
Foskett was accompanied by William Goodridge and a third man, probably, Mr.
Marriott on a four day fund raising trip to Northampton and Rothersthorpe in
February 1826. Their expenses totalled 19s 8d. Whilst this hardly afforded too
much extravagance and a healthy £9 7s was raised, future visits were generally
undertaken by George Foskett alone. (NRO BlB19) Additional contributions
amounting to £85 came from the Baptist Building Fund. Thus William Goodridge
could proudly proclaim in that on July 30<sup>th</sup> 1833 the entire debt was
settled.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">As with most projects the opening service in 1825 had
actually taken place before all work was completed. Naturally the work had been
contracted out, though members, attendees at services and their families were
clearly used when possible. In 1825 Edward Johnson was paid £232 2s 9d, “as
bill” and £1 6s for sand. He had donated money and was presumably related to
Lucy Johnson. In 1828 he was paid £2 10s 10d for demolishing a privy and
building two new ones at the church. An E. Johnson became the twelfth member of
the Church and died in 1831. Leonard Dunkley, paid £308 7s 4 ½d in 1825 and 8s
for erecting a pulpit in 1826, was never a member of the Blisworth Church,
though Dunkleys from the village became members later on. Both Johnson and
Dunkley were paid for work on the baptistry later on. One other person who was,
at least, a friend was paid for goods: William Campion. Interestingly, business
– though only for a few pounds - was transacted in 1830 with Benedict Roper,
son of that opponent of Non-Conformity, John Roper - who may also have sold
materials to the Baptists.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Other expenses up to 1833 included £3 2s spent at the
Royal Oak by ministers invited to attend and preach at George Foskett’s
ordination as minister; two and six for a book for writing a petition to
Parliament, money for Mr. Foskett’s writing paper and, intriguingly 10s 9d
paid to Mr. Foskett “out of begging”.&nbsp; This probably refers to a fund raising
trip, but given the tenuous nature of a village non-conformist ministers
finances in the first part of the nineteenth century the remark could show
William Goodridge’s frustration at being badgered for money. Such expenses
were now easily covered as the debt disappeared. (NRO BlB19)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">A new Church - meaning the people rather than the
building - was not constituted until November 1825. Ministers from Northampton,
Roade, Towcester, Bugbrook (sic), and Hackleton attended a special service. The
new church now required organisation, a pastor – who would have to be
supported financially to some degree – a constitution and so on. It would also
need to spread the word and increase its numbers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The covenant was simple. The members who made up the
Church declared that this was a Church of Calvinist Dissenters commonly called
Particular Baptists. This was a reference to their belief in predestination,
that they were an elect group who would be saved by God. General Baptists, who
were losing identity, believed in the possibility of salvation for all. It would
be easy to see Particular Baptists as being rather snobbish and arrogant. Indeed
it was this insistence on being an elect group that sometimes limited appeal.
However, there is no reason to think that the Blisworth Church was particularly
exclusive. Initially they held on to “closed communion” – only members
allowed to take communion – but a note, probably of later date, states that
this was not “always so”. (NRO BlB7)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Being a member meant promising “conscientious
observance to keep unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace.” (NRO BlB7)
There was a clear ethos of group identity and discipline. Members promised to
“watch over … admonish … and encourage one another.” Prayer meetings and
social interaction for cohesion, regular attendance at services and communion,
and the setting of a good public example were all required.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Discipline could be strict, but acknowledgement of fault
and submission to the will of God, sufficed for the Church Meeting which made
decisions on all matters. The first member to be disciplined was William Wood,
who in 1827 was suspended from membership for “improper conduct and absenting
himself from the Lord’s Table”. He was fully excluded in 1829, presumably
because he had failed to show contrition or amend his conduct. George Foskett,
the pastor recorded few details of disciplinary issues. A second exclusion, for
dishonesty was followed by the “restoration” to membership of William
Rockingham. Fortunately the Deacons who kept records in the period between<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>the pastorships of George Foskett and John Goddard Stephens, who became
the second full time pastor in 1841, recorded rather more. (NRO Bl B 7)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">George Plowman managed to be excluded twice. The first
exclusion followed “disorderly conduct in a public house.” He was soon taken
back into the Church. However, in 1841 he was excluded again, for “unbecoming
familiarity with a woman on the road.” This seemingly scandalous behaviour
seems, according to family tradition, to have amounted to staring at either her
ankles or visible parts of undergarment. Eight months later he was restored once
more. Whilst Plowman may appear to be a bit of a rogue who took his punishment
and was taken back to the Church, there was a real sense in which Church
discipline moderated conduct. George Paxton was excluded for “disgracing his
profession” – it is not clear if this refers to his job or his profession of
faith – and, significantly, “ill-treating his wife” and generally being
“disorderly”. Later on, John Ayres, a policeman on the railway, was excluded
partly because he had run up considerable debts. The <a href="../Lyrical/edgar-ayres.htm"> Ayres family</a> later became
active Anglicans. The discipline of the Church Meeting covered personal conduct,
social responsibility as well as spiritual observance. (NRO BL B 7)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">There was, however, no shortage of people wanting to
become members of the Church. Amongst them were familiar surnames: Johnson,
Campion, Marriott, Woodhouse, Clarke, Rockingham, Deacon as well as some that
would became notable in the future: Westley, Lepper, Pacey and, later, numerous
Plowmans. Between April 1826 and October 1835 there were twenty-seven new
members. Most of these were from within the Blisworth congregation following
baptism. Three new members joined through “honourable dismission” (with a
recommendation from another Baptist Church). Two came from Roade and one from
Towcester. A fourth member joined “by letter”: Mary Deacon – another
familiar surname. (NRO Bl B 7)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">It seems that recruitment to membership was mainly from
within the congregation. For a suitable pastor the Church needed to look further
afield. The process was for a Church to find someone who was available or
willing to come, to examine the candidate carefully and hear him preach and then
decide. Often this could take a good deal of time. George Foskett originated
from Newport Pagnell and was a probationary preacher at the Baptist Church in
Leighton Buzzard. He was invited to become pastor at Blisworth. In 1826 he and
his wife became members of the Church and, in September, he was ordained. His
clear, rather sweeping, handwriting is in the pages of the Church Book. There
are a few blots, for example where he seems to have paused over the suspension
of William Wood. One blot appears to have been turned into a little insect by
drawing out thin lines of ink. For the later entries the hand becomes unsteady,
until, in another hand, Foskett’s death, after a long illness, is recorded.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">On Foskett’s death in 1838 the search for a new pastor
began. As time went by and no candidate emerged, John Bray was appointed as
minister to the Church for one year. This caused some friction, though the
reason is not clear. William Goodridge refused to act as Deacon or receive
collections whilst Bray remained minister: a strong reaction from a founding
member of the Church, who was later re-elected as a Deacon in 1841 and kept the
Church accounts until his death in January 1855. (NRO BlB7/BlB11)</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">John Goddard Stephens became pastor in 1841, joining the
Blisworth Church from Kidderminster. Mary Stephens, his wife joined the Church
in 1845. When Stephens left to become pastor at Bugbrooke he was eventually
replaced by Reuben Turner, of Bythorn. He left in 1855 to become pastor at
Desborough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>William Paine was asked
to be pastor for a year, but towards the end of that short period he fell ill
and retired to London, where he died shortly after. Short pastorates were not
unusual but did not help the cause of either pastor or Church.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">One reason behind the rapid turnover in many places was
that the pastor had little chance of making a living in a small village. He
needed another trade, possibly a schoolmaster, or craftsman, such as a
shoemaker. Full time pastors had to evangelise and recruit enough wealthy
members to make a living. In many places this was clearly not possible. At the
same time, the Baptist pastor may have little education: as late as 1871 fewer
than 60% had been trained at one of the Baptist Colleges. Most seem to have come
from an artisan background, though some had very humble origins. The desire to
find a Church that could offer more than £65 a year (the average income, not
necessarily all in ready money, estimated by the Baptist Union in 1860 to be the
minimum needed to support a minister) must have driven pastors to move on. (J.H.Y
Briggs, The English Baptists of the Nineteenth Century, Didcot, 1994 pages 88
– 95) Having said that, there is no reason to suggest that relations between
pastor and people were poor. However, the 1850s seemed to be a period of
difficulty for the Baptist cause in Blisworth. It was also the decade that
ushered in what must have seemed like a golden age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><b><font color="#000080">“It is to be hoped that we may soon have something
better ..”<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The Westley family were prominent in many aspects of
Blisworth life in the second half of the nineteenth century, not least as
leading Baptists and entrepreneurs. Joseph Westley was a deacon of the Church,
forthright defender of the rights of Baptist children at the village school, was
on many of the Baptist committees – which were numerous – and, we are told,
twisted the arm of employees when it came to attendance at the Baptist Church.
As the period 1780 to 1828 could be described as the Goodridge years, so the
second half of the nineteenth century could be the Westley years.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">It is true that Joseph Westley forced the Rector and
Schoolmaster to excuse children of Dissenting, including Baptist, parents from
learning<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the Church catechism. That
he was able to do this reflected both his commitment to the cause of
non-conformity and his financial clout. The parish schoolroom, newly erected and
furnished, had incurred debt for desks and other fittings. The curate applied to
Westley – not to the Baptist Church – for a subscription. Clearly, the
leading businessman of the village could be expected to stump up generously. The
Rector had no choice but to meet the condition laid down by Westley. This
influence was decidedly temporal rather than spiritual.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Joseph Westley became a member of Blisworth Baptist
Church in 1856, along with Elizabeth Westley, William Hobbs and John Hedge. The
anonymous writer of the 1900<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>manuscript
declares that this was a magnificent year because it brought into the Church men
who were to lead it forward with vigour and decision: Westley was identified as
one, the other was a farmer by the name of John Tite Cave. Both were deacons and
both were clearly thought of as leading lights.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Equally, whilst Joseph Westley served on all the
committees established to deal with the many issues facing the Church, so did
several others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, for many
years William Woodhouse was described as the senior deacon. The start of the
rapid growth that characterised the fortunes of the Blisworth Baptists in the
second half of the nineteenth century coincided not only with the arrival of
Joseph Westley and John Cave, but also with the pastorships of George Bailey
and George Jarman.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">It is clear that the reasons for the growth of Baptism
in Blisworth after 1856 grew from more than the influence of one man,
significant though this was. Whether Joseph Westley employed only those who
would attend Baptist services is unclear. Local lore supports the view that this
was indeed the case. However, this is contradicted to some extent by the
assertion that the houses the Westleys built in the village were not solely for
the use of Baptists. Moreover, Westley was also a warden of the parish Church.
There is, in short, no evidence, written or circumstantial, to support assertions
of bias in Westley's attitude to his employees.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Between 1841 and 1851 the Church book is mostly a list of
baptisms and disciplinary issues. William Goodridge, William Woodhouse and
Joseph Marriott were elected deacons in February 1841. In the following years
more members joined from Roade and there were several baptisms. In 1851 the new
pastor, the Reverend Reuben Turner decided to keep more accurate minutes of
meetings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even so, they do not
become much more informative, though two entries perhaps indicate that there was
concern over certain issues.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">On Christmas Day, 1851, a proposal was adopted that
“we think it desirable to draw out the tendencies to an open avowal of
attachment to Christ, where they exist, and in order to do this we think it
right to invite such persons to mingle with us more freely.” (NRO BlB7) This,
presumably indicates concern that the Church was too exclusive and that
potential Baptists were being scared off by the apparent exclusiveness of the
Particular Baptists. Equally, the need to maintain an identity as Baptists is
clearly present. The Membership of the Church was ageing. However, this was not
the only problem; discipline and attendance were deteriorating. Turner noted in
Feb 1853 that the baptism of Phoebe Pacey was nearly ruined by a rush of girls
and boys against the baptistry railing. Turner also found himself taking action
against William Rockingham – a member of long standing – for non-attendance
and making several visitation to others in an attempt to maintain unity and
discipline. It may, of course, be the case that splits were occurring because of
the resolution to allow non-members to mingle more freely in the Church. Five
years later, a few months into the pastorate of George Bailey, it is notable
that Joseph Westley addressed the Church meeting on the best means of keeping
peace and unity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The problems were also addressed by holding prayer
meetings for parents and for young people linked to the congregation as well as
holding<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>social meetings. It is
after a record of one of these, in January1855, that the death of William
Goodridge is noted.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">William Goodridge had been a deacon since the
establishment of the Church, except for one notable period when he refused to
serve, because he objected to the pastor. He has kept the Church accounts,
though his notebooks are far from easy to read, undoubtedly they enabled him to
keep a close eye on income and expenditure, especially during the building of
the Chapel and associated fund raising. He had outlived John Goodridge by
twenty-six years.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">There are no minutes of meetings from April 1855 to
September 1857. Reuben Turner had left, but Westley and Cave had arrived. A new
spirit was clearly present by the time George Bailey was welcomed as pastor at a
public tea meeting, organised by Joseph Westley, on October 29th, 1857. From
this point on a fresh sense of purpose pervades the minutes. The written word,
it seems, to be was acted out.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The policy was to evangelise and adopt a higher profile.
Cottage meetings were initiated and held during the winter. These were aimed to
attract people who live near the venue or those who did not like to set out on
the muddy roads in the pitch dark of a winter night to come to the Church. The
only measure of success we have is that they were continued in future years.
Henry Plowman, an very active member of the Church, held prayer meetings every
two weeks in Gayton for a number of years.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">If Westley, Cave and others were ambitious for their
Church, George Bailey was their man as pastor. At his first meeting the new
pastor declared that he hoped they might soon have something better for lighting
than candles. He went on to insist on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“formal
and regular attendance at all meetings and services.” Above all he exhorted
“personal efforts to draw in the unconverted.” The combination of strong
pastor and influential figures seems to have united the Church, or, at least,
quietened debate and turned eyes to the people outside.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Evangelism was formalised in September 1858. It was
resolved that each member should talk to two non-members, either in the
congregation or outside of it and report back to the Church meeting. Some had
already started and success was noted. Earlier in the year there had been a
Sabbath School Festival – with the inevitable tea – in William Pettifer's
orchard. Whilst the children had to be “plentifully regaled” by preaching
before they could eat, there was an address by the pastor's son. It seems that
the Baptists were becoming more aware of their potential audience: a younger
speaker for the children and, at the end of 1858, a suggestion that if prayers
were shorter they may be of more interest to the hearers. The annual treat
became a regular feature in the eighteen-fifties and sixties. They were held on
the farms of leading Church members, such as John Cave or the Campions.
Strangely, according to the Church book, the sun always seems to have shone
until the children headed for home between eight and nine o'clock. On one
occasion at least children from Milton Malsor Church were invited along.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">In similar fashion the form of meetings and services was
constantly discussed. Social meetings were held for members and later, quarterly
conversation evenings were held where important issues could be aired. New<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>times for Sunday services were experimented with, as well as whether
children should be present for the service or whether separate services should
be held. The format of services was changed in 1870. The previous format can be
inferred from this. The new morning service would follow this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>pattern; prayer – sing – read<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>-
pray chant - read – pray – sing -sermon – sing – conclude. The evening
service pattern was the same, with the exception of the last prayer. The
motivation for this change was to break up and shorten what had become known as
the long prayer. It was felt that this lost the attention of some members of the
congregation. During the pastorship of George Jarman we find frequent comments
on the services, written by the pastor himself. “Unusually interesting”,
“A most interesting service”, seem to demonstrate the new pastors sense of
the importance of addressing an audience beyond the committed membership and
regular attendees.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">This then was the response to stagnation and the
enthusiasm for evangelism. It was also a response to the Wesleyan Methodists.
Whist these were described as “friends” they were also rivals as an
alternative to the Anglican Church. Methodism had been associated with
Anglicanism, but had never been able to reconcile itself with the established
church. Whilst Baptism and other Old Dissenting sects were strongest amongst the
artisans and yeomen, Methodism made a direct appeal to the labouring class. The
Methodists had licensed a house in the centre of the village for the purpose of
worship, but also preached outdoors. In the battle the Baptists had struck a
blow in January 1859 when Benjamin and Elizabeth Whitlock, formerly Methodists
asked to join the Baptists. However, in June of the same year it seemed that
some Baptists were getting too close to their Methodist friends. A Sunday
afternoon prayer meeting was held in William Rockingham's house. However, this
was being disturbed. Methodists had secured preachers to preach in the house
opposite and had attempted, successfully, to persuade some at the Baptist
meeting to come and preach to them. Clearly, the ordinary folk did not realise
how dangerous such ecumenism was. The Baptist Church meeting recognised the
freedom of individuals to attend “outdoor meetings”, they decided to move
the prayer meeting to another venue, though it soon returned to William
Rockingham's cottage. Methodism did not flourish in Blisworth.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">On the whole relations between the Baptists and other
non-conformist Churches were good. Several members seeking dismission from
Blisworth Baptist Church joined Congregational or Independent Churches in the
towns they moved to. Equally, a Wesleyan Methodist named Henry Bottrell who had
come to Blisworth from Rugby was allowed to commune with the Bisworth Baptists,
supported as he was by a letter from a Methodist minister in his home town. It
seems likely that there was no longer any significant methodist presence in the
village. Almost exactly one year later in July 1869 the issue of granting full
membership to members of other denominations was discussed at one of the
quarterly conversation meetings. The resolution, taken up by the Church Meeting,
was that they should be, providing that their Christian character was beyond
doubt.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">New members and old had a full range of religious
meetings to join in. These could be intense and to attend all would have
required considerable commitment, even in an age before television. Social
meetings, special tea meetings, two services and Sabbath School on Sunday,
Church Meeting, sometimes after Sunday morning service, for members, cottage
prayer meetings, meetings of the Sabbath School Teachers, meetings of Deacons.
Apart from Sunday the usual programme of events for a week in 1859 was;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:84.75pt"><font color="#000080">Monday : Missionary
Society/Church/Cottage Meetings</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:84.75pt"><font color="#000080">Tuesday: Bible Classes</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:84.75pt"><font color="#000080">Wednesday: Lectures</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:84.75pt"><font color="#000080">Thursday : Evening Singing
Classes</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><font color="#000080">This was during winter.
Attendance at all events was encouraged though it was clearly not consistent,
nor could it really have been expected. Indeed during harvest, including the hay
harvest, meetings might even be cancelled. There were always prayers for the
harvest and a harvest home service. Despite Blisworth's industrial sector, this
was very much a rural community moving to the rhythm of the farming year. The
Sunday School Treat took place between hay and grain harvests.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><font color="#000080">Prayer was, of course at the
heart of all activities. The first prayer meeting of the year was always held at
six in the morning on January 1st. The first week of the year was a week of
prayer, ordained so by the Evangelical Alliance. In 1869 the focus of prayers
was as follows,</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:85.5pt"><font color="#000080">Monday January 4<sup>th</sup>
: for the work of Missionaries.<br>
Tuesday January 5<sup>th</sup>
: for the young.<br>
Wednesday January 6<sup>th</sup>
: for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit<br>
Thursday January 7<sup>th</sup>
: for enquirers (i.e. those seeking baptism)<br>
Friday January 8<sup>th</sup>
: for the Church and Congregation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><font color="#000080">There were regular prayers for
the young and for their parents. All meetings had prayers at some stage because,
of course in the view of those present, without God's guidance no decision could
be made. These prayers were offered by many different members as well as the
pastor. Often there was singing, too.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><font color="#000080">It was not only the Pastor who
preached, though others had to seek the sanction of the Meeting and consult with
the Pastor before doing so. When George Bailey was ill in 1863 he went away to
Hastings to benefit from the sea air. In his place George Hickson and “the
youth” Billingham preached. Later others were given this opportunity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><font color="#000080">Teas were not uniquely Baptist
, however, throughout the eighteen fifties and sixties and onwards, they were
frequent. They might be public or private; “no strangers” were invited to
attend the tea to welcome George Jarman as pastor on November 12<sup>th</sup>
1868. However, three months later at his ordination tea, which had to be held
indoors because of the time of year,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>230
people took tea in the vestry and the schoolroom. At the service several people
were unable get in because of the crowd. In June that year some 450 took tea
“in the Chapel and in front of it.” Special services and teas were also the
focus of the major celebrations when the work to extend the buildings was
completed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><b><font color="#000080">Looking Inward and Outward<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><font color="#000080">The Church Meeting was the
government of the Church. It selected the pastor and by it the deacons were
elected. All members could attend and speak. Although it the recorded business,
the minutes of which vary greatly from pastor to pastor, tended to be dominated
by a relatively small number of men, the meeting was attended by both men and
women. There is only one example of women proposing and seconding<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>a motion. However, even when the thorough George Jarman was keeping the
minutes – it seems that the pastor acted as secretary – there is no record
of discussion. Occasionally there is mention that debate took place, even of
dissension. However, it seems that most proposals were carried unanimously.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-left:.75pt"><font color="#000080">The main business recorded
between 1825 and 1872, at which point the Church Book comes to a sudden end,
consisted of admissions to membership, discipline, evangelism, buildings and
expenses, responses to appeals for money from other organisations, appointment
of messengers and some sundry business.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Between 1825 and the mid eighteen-fifties admissions
were relatively small in number. As the number grew the way in which matters
were conducted becomes clearer. An enquirer (a non-member seeking baptism) might
approach a member of the Church, or, noting a “tendency towards Christ” in a
member of the congregation, the member would raise the “enquirer” with the
Church meeting. The meeting then appointed messengers to meet with the
candidate. They reported back to the Church Meeting where acceptance would be
proposed and seconded and, without exception, accepted. The enquirer would be
required to recount their religious journey, but, on the whole the
recommendation of the messengers was accepted. Of course, they were interviewing
people who wanted to become members. Baptism followed shortly after. The
messengers were drawn from the membership of the Church: women were always sent
to see female candidates and men to males. Joseph Westley sometimes acted in
this capacity, but so did William Lepper, Henry Plowman, William Woodhouse,
Sarah Woodhouse, Mrs Bailey and Mrs. Jarman, wives of the pastors, the two Mrs.
Hicksons and many others. They were not asked to visit their close relatives.
This system did not always work and as the number of enquirers grew in the
eighteen sixties, messengers were appointed to act a month at a time. It seems
that this did not work<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>either and
ad hoc appointments remained the norm. The other means of joining the Church was
by dismission from another Church, which required a letter from the Meeting of
that Church.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Members were occasionally dismissed to other Churches.
Others left because they “passed on to that next great Church.” Few were
dismissed for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>disciplinary reasons.
In fact disciplinary hearings at the Meeting were few and far between. Yet they
were important because the members of the Church felt that the conduct of
individual reflected upon each one of them and the Church in general. Action was
rarely harsh and judgement seldom quickly reached. Wandering sheep had plenty of
paths home. In 1860 Elizabeth Mallard had been absenting herself from public
worship at the Chapel, in general, and from communion, in particular. At the
Church Meeting in February 1861 her case was discussed, with “indecent
anger” and “lack of integrity” added to the charges. A strong reprimand
was issued, though her membership was to continue if attendance improved. Later
that year there was a review of all members and messengers were sent to those
who were not attending on a frequent and regular basis.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The Church Meeting, as one would expect, was unwilling
to discipline members without sufficient evidence. Charges made against John
Gaseryne by “his Master”, were found to be without foundation and were
withdrawn. Enticingly, the minutes for November 1861 refer to the deferral of
discussion of “”rumours relating to an absent and distant member.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not all members lived in Blisworth or sought dismission if they moved
away. This became an increasingly serious issue as more young female members
moved away into service as the nineteenth century progressed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">However, a “servant problem” was to manifest itself
in the heart of the Blisworth Baptist Church in 1871, causing “confusion and
humiliation”. On October 29<sup>th</sup> a special meeting was informed that
Elizabeth Smith, a servant girl, living at John Cave's farm was with child. The
father was apparently George Smith, likewise a live-in servant at the farm. This
was, of course, made more embarrassing because John Cave was such a prominent
member of the Church. The couple were suspended, seen by George Jarman, the
Pastor, and watched for signs of repentance once they had admitted their error.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">Mary Ann Durrant received a solemn reprimand for having
her child baptised in the parish Church. This, as well as most of the cases
cited above, were important to the Church meeting because they were matters of
commitment to Christ, but also because they reflected on the Baptists community
as a whole. Respectability, both collective and individual, mattered.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font color="#000080">The only disciplinary action resulting in expulsion
between 1850 and 1872 occurred in 1862.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
relevant minute of the meeting of September 7<sup>th</sup> is quoted in full,
because it draws out some of the main themes of Baptist life in the village;</font></p>

was readmitted to membership has again deserted the worship and communion of

this Church for those and other causes it was unanimously Resolved (sic) that
from this time her membership shall cease. Also for repeated neglect of public

suggest that expulsion of Susan Paxton was partly because of the offence caused
to the Meeting by her mother, it is clear that Sarah was not rushed out o the
door. It is equally clear that main expectations were that services would be
attended; serious error could be atoned for by recognition of fault; marriage
outside the baptist community was acceptable, but not to an “ungodly and
immoral man”; public conduct mattered to the Church; God was dishonoured and
the image of the Church was soiled by Sarah Paxton's conduct, at least in the
eyes of the Church members.</font></p>

and some of the above may well have echoed around the village. Whether the alms
given by the Church to some members made local gossip, we do not know. They were
actually few and far between, though, as we shall see, the Church supported
numerous good Baptist and ecumenical causes. There are only two gifts to
individuals recorded in the Church Book between 1825 and 1872; thirteen
shillings were collected and given to “our afflicted Brother Joseph
Marriott” and financial comfort was offered to Brother Marsh, who had lost
five sheep in a thunder storm.</font></p>

Messengers were sent to Northamptonshire Baptist Association meetings. It is
likely that collections were taken for a variety of external causes well before
records of these start in 1857. An annual beneficiary was Northampton Infirmary.
The orphans and widows of missionaries from the Baptist Foreign Missionary
Society also received an annual collection. There were also collections or
subscriptions for the Baptist Bible Translation Society, whilst the Baptist
Foreign Missionary Society and the Home Missionary Society, The Irish Baptist
Mission, The Baptist Building Fund, Orphanages of London and the
Northamptonshire Sunday School Union also benefitted from subscription teas. The
Churches at Thetford and Uxbridge were also given aid. Occasionally, demands
grew too great and support was deferred or left to individuals. Often members,
including the children, kept collection boxes. It is to the credit of
Blisworthians of this era that at least one was kept at the cottage gate and
still contained coins when brought to Church. In 1864 the Blisworth church
became a member of the Baptist Union</font></p>

Alexandra of Denmark in 1863, despite the fact that<span style="mso-spacerun:

union. The Blisworth Baptists held a special service and offered their prayers.
Few events away from the village are mentioned in the Church Book. This should
not come as a surprise, there were other places for discussing this world. One
that is refers to the “general sympathy” felt for the two hundred and
nineteen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>men who had died when a
crane fell down a shaft: the widows and orphans were probably remembered in the
prayers that followed the Meeting, too. In 1862<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>£7 0s 9d and a box and packet of clothing were sent to relieve the
plight of Lancashire cotton workers, suffering at the time because of the
blockade of the ports of the Confederate states by the Union navy during the
American Civil War, that stopped American cotton imports to Britain. In 1865 it
was resolved to offer support to people in Jamaica, after receiving a letter.</font></p>

towards the Liberal Party politically. Most members would have been unable to
vote until 1867, and even then some men and all women would have been excluded
from the political process. However, petitions offered the opportunity to make
demands on Parliament. The Blisworth Baptists joined in national petitions. In
1860 they called fro the total abolition of Church Rates; the next year a
petition was sent in support of a Bill to allow those who died unbaptised to be
buried in the parish graveyard. In 1864 they gave support to a national campaign
to close pubs from 4.00 pm on Saturday to 6.00 am on Monday morning.</font></p>

in the Afternoon we lay a Glass Bottle in the foundation at the western corner
in front of the Minister's House under the lowest white stone which is the
memorial Stone. The bottle contains a Copy of the Freeman Baptist Newspaper of
the 17<sup>th</sup> of May 1865; A Handbill of this Meeting; and by the request
the Pastor's manuscript sermon; a sample of wheat grown by John Tite Cave; a
sample of kidney beans and cucumber seeds grown by Joseph Westley; a sample of
field beans grown by John Campion; a piece of Ox's hoof – a hierloom of 60
years by William Lepper; and in honour of our beloved Queen Victoria the widow's
two half farthings by Edward Campion; and a silver shilling by Joseph Westley.
The cost of these building alterations and enlargements is estimated at £800
when completed. The amount of contributions towards the amount of the debt is £472
with promises sure and good making it to £500. Now the Bottle with its contents
being deposited and when the Rev. J.T. Brown the beloved pastor of the Baptist
Church in College Street Northampton has laid its Memorial Stone securely over
it May the hand of violence never disturb them. May the House to be built here
be occupied by Godly Pastors through many generations. Signed</font></p>

were privies. It is noteworthy that it is at this time that the Church buildings
became clearly visible from the road with something of the appearance they have
today. Much of the work seems to have been done by the members and congregation
of the Church. In November, Joseph Westley told the Church Meeting that the
“use of horses and cartage of 2000 tons of earth had been freely conveyed
without charge – that the cooperation ... of the labouring classes and trades
people after their daily toil had been cheerfully given and thankfully
received.” At the same meeting it was noted that the entire debt had now been
paid off by “five friends of the Church and Congregation”. The project had
come in nearly 50% over initial estimate, at £1122 exactly.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">Two teas were held to
celebrate the opening of the Chapel. The first was held on October 5th, the day
of the opening, with between 300 and 400 people sitting down in the “open air
and at the front of the Chapel”. Exactly who attended this tea is unclear, but
it would certainly have included the pastor, guests, deacons, committee ans
Church members and their families. The labouring folk and the “poorer
classes” were largely excluded from this – presumably not because of social
status alone, though this was probably part of the reason – and a separate
sixpenny tea was provided “subsequently”. There were 160 at this event, held
in the Vestry and Schoolroom. It was described as an acknowledgement of “their
generous assistance”: Doubtless they were appreciative.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">The buildings
were inadequate in other respects, as was known in 1865, for the numbers in the congregation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>and the pupils in the Sunday School. Thus in March 1871

and the usual celebration tea was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>well
attended. Ministers came from as far a field as Clipston, near the Leicestershire
border, and Birmingham. It was hoped that the debt could be paid off in three
years, with each member asked to contribute one third of what they had already
given in each of the years. However, in the long run the expectation was that
“each one to offer voluntarily what he can find.”</font></p>

Church book
comes to an end. Thus the detailed, though rather one-sided, picture given of
the Baptists ceases. It tells of their concerns and their attitudes; their hopes
and fears. One-sided it may be, but there is no less detail of disciplinary
issues than there is of general day-to-day business. Where there were great
achievements it is only natural that they were given greater emphasis. Great
achievements there had been, too. The stagnation of the mid century had been
turned to a forward march of progress; new and extended buildings, increasing
membership, involvement with the Baptist Union and a wide variety of good causes
and political campaigns. The huge numbers attending tea might not reflect
religious conviction, but they do demonstrate significant social impact. The
extent to which children at the Sunday School gained educational opportunities
that they would not otherwise have got is hard to estimate. Likewise, the
benefit of the Clothing Club, the lectures, social evenings and the importance
in a small rural community of belonging, cannot be fathomed from the evidence
available. It is hard to imagine, however, that the Baptists did not make an
impact on individual members and their families as well as the village as a
whole.</font></p>

morning of February 12th, 1870. He had been one of the original members of the
Church who had sought dismission from Roade in 1825. He had been Deacon and
Superintendent and Teacher in the Sabbath School. In the early days of the
Church he had<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>probably been
energetic in tramping the surrounding area in search of support for the new
Church at Blisworth from other Baptist communities. Later he had been a
messenger to candidates for baptism and to all the Association Meetings and
other important events. He was clearly a dedicated man who adjusted to change
successfully, though it might be suggested not quickly. At one point , on Boxing
Day 1859, he told the Church Meeting that “if it desired another Deacon” he
hoped “they would not hesitate about doing so out of any delicacy of feeling
towards himself.” However, whilst this may reflect disagreements over the way
forward under George Bailey<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- this
was after all only a year and a half after Joseph Westley had lectured the
Meeting on the best way to maintain peace and unity – it does not signify
great schism. Maybe Woodhouse was seen as the old conservative, though that is
mere speculation. Woodhouse's statement could equally be related to the fact
that he had just returned from a series of meetings about religious renewal.
Whatever the issue was, he remained active as Deacon for another eleven years.
He died “his faith in Christ unswerving”, which had undoubtedly been his
motivation throughout the years of service. An indication that his influence and
wisdom was respected is that those who had attended Sabbath School (which was a
considerable number) subscribed to a tombstone for him.</font></p>

Church contained a full cross-section of village society – with the exception
of the bigger landowners. The members ranged from the entrepreneurial Joseph
Westley and the tenant farmer, such as John Cave,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>to servants such as the maligned John Gaseryne and William Pettifer's
servant girl. However, the leadership of the Church was firmly in the hands of
the more prosperous male members. Women attended Church Meetings, but there is
only one recorded motion proposed and seconded by women (Charity Rockingham and
Sarah Hickson). This was really a reflection of society as a whole, of course.
Women were, as we have seen, active in the Church, but within what were seen as
acceptable roles at that time.</font></p>

became more organised and more hierarchical. Specific responsibilities began to
be delegated, for example for the burial ground. Members were instructed to
occupy the central pews during services, whilst the rest of the congregation sat
on either side. It is no coincidence that the poorer classes had a sixpenny tea
when the new buildings were opened in 1864, whilst the first tea was presumably
taken by members and the better off attenders in the congregation. In 1872 tasks
were assigned to specific people, disregarding position as Deacon, treasurer and
so on. These were not offices in the Church structure, but related to specific
tasks;</font></p>

sight, peculiar duties was “watching for strangers in the congregation.”
Presumably the aim was to make them welcome and evangelise rather than to

Church book
for 1825 to 1872 ends. The period that follows is more obscure, until more

Church that entered the last quarter of the nineteenth century in confident
frame of mind.<o:p>

</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">The
main source that has so far come to my notice for this period is the anonymous
manuscript history of 1900. (NRO BlB3) This is not obviously an always
even-handed document and needs some care, especially as it approaches the turn
of the century.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">The
reaction to the improvements to the Chapel and the additional buildings seems to
have had a surprisingly mixed reaction. It seems that the author's view that
“It would be a good thing if every village had such a chapel” was not
unanimous. “Some felt that the Chapel was larger and finer than it should be
and some said they would give nothing to so much being spent upon it.”&nbsp;
The clear inference of this is that even before building commenced there was
opposition to what some saw as extravagance. How far, if at all, this reflected
deeper divisions is hard to say, nor do we know who the opposition were. A
Marxist writer might seek out social divisions. Interestingly, there is no
record of dissent or of the dissenting voices. They may not have had the power
to make their opposition effective, or, just as likely, any documentary evidence
of complaint has been lost. It is entirely possible that the increasing
dominance of a few wealthy individuals and the growth of a more hierarchical
structure in what was a free association of equals was felt by some to be
unfair, not to say inappropriate, and that the ostentation, as they saw it, of
the new Chapel was a symbol of this. It is equally likely that there were simply
those who held a more primitive attitude to their religion. Sadly all is
speculative and is likely to remain so.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">Despite
this the debts from the building programme were rapidly paid off. Two hundred
and thirteen pounds were wiped off the slate in April 1873 by the proceeds of a
three day long bazaar. The final debt was cleared in September 1874 at the
anniversary celebrations of the reopening. The money came from the collection
and “three or four friends”. The latter are unnamed, but it is likely they
were the usual men. After all there were few who could afford to make such
significant donations.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">Moreover,
there was stability in the Deaconate. If there was dissension the opposition was
never in position to carry out a village <i>coup d'etat</i>. However, maybe they
were few in number or their opposition not so deeply felt.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">It is
likely that all Blisworth Baptists would have felt a sense of pride that their
new buildings were the venue for the Northamptonshire Association meeting in
1873. This important event was held at Blisworth for a second time in 1888.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">The
author of the anonymous manuscript describes William Mills' pastorate<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(August 1874 to August 1882) as “sunny days for this little hill of
Zion.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly the author
approved. Without doubt the most significant event during this period was the
Chapel Jubilee in 1875, which was held on September 15th, 1875. As usual there
was communal breakfast and tea, whist the children marched around the village
and and hymns at places of historic importance to the Baptists. No record of
their route exists, a great shame. There was an afternoon sermon and communion
was held. Tea was followed by a public meeting in the evening. Most remarkable
and perhaps most indicative of the Church's development was the breakfast. This
was given to the Sunday School children and eight adults. The adults sat on a
separate form. The combined age of the eight, all men, was six hundred years.
All had been present at the opening of the first chapel.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">The
number sitting down to tea at the Jubilee was 200. A large number, though not as
large as it had been at some previous events. The Church remained prosperous. In
1885 a new lecture hall was opened at a cost of £390 and £200 was spent on
renovating the Chapel. All this was cleared by 1887. This was during the
pastorate of Herbert Trotman (December 1882 to December 1887)<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:1.5pt"><font color="#000080">Both
Mills and Trotman are mentioned by name. Alfed Barnes (March 1888 to May 1890),
seems to have been a popular choice with some. A relatively young man, it was
hoped that he would encourage attendance and membership amongst young men –
though a younger pastor might also have had attractions for females, too. This
was important because recruitment had, for many years, been strongest amongst
females. His death in 1890 may well have come as a disappointment.<o:p>

latter did not meet with the approval of our anonymous writer in 1900.<o:p>

0cm;margin-left:73.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font color="#000080">The position
of pastor has been too unworthily filled .... thirty-five new members,
forty-eight lost .... a time of loss and change ... Our missionary gathering and
contributions are not what they used to be. At one time we had between 200 and
400 to tea and our contribution was not less than £30 to £40. This year we had
80 persons to tea and sent up as our contribution not quite £15.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:0cm"><font color="#000080">A falling
off in other areas of Church life is noted. Sadly neither what these were nor
the writer's views on the reasons for them or the unworthiness of the pastor are
given.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:0cm"><font color="#000080">Whatever
lay behind the writers claims there was clearly something amiss, given the
decline in tea attenders – something Baptists rarely seem to decline – and
the amount of money raised for an important aspect of Baptists activity in the
late nineteenth century. However, the membership statistics do not support such
a pessimistic view in the long term.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:0cm"><font color="#000080">There was
a major increase in membership in 1889, during the pastorate of Alfred Barnes
and a major decline in the last year of that of Fred Hughes. This is followed by
an immediate<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>increase and longer
term decline. The membership never again reached the level of 1892, though there
was a significant recovery by 1904. It is dangerous to make too much of short
term fluctuations, such as those of 1893 to 1894. After all a bad year for the
old might easily wipe several members off the list.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:0cm"><font color="#000080">Whether
the appointment of Henry Wyatt caused a rift or if his conduct or ministry lead
to concerns is not clear. There is no doubt that during his pastorate membership
went down and when he left it recovered. During that period it fluctuated. It is
always tempting to blame individuals for ills, even more so in the absence of
any other evidence.</font></p>

clue to the obvious disapproval of Henry Wyatt lies in the phrase “a time of
loss and change”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Blisworth
Baptist Church newsletter for May 1897 (kindly sent in by </font><font color="#000080">Honor
Handford)</font><font color="#000080"> refers to a Service of Song at Milton on
Good Friday. There was a tea and the Sunday School children thoroughly enjoyed
it. The attendance was not quite what it had been on previous occasions. A
change is mooted.<o:p>

0cm;margin-left:71.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font color="#000080">It is felt
by some that a change from the Service of Song would be very agreeable. The fact
that nothing else has been given on Good Friday for many years is not a
sufficient reason for keeping always to the one thing, if something better can
be substituted. A local Eisteddfod has been suggested. There is ample time to
consider the matter before next year.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:.75pt"><font color="#000080">The
tone suggests that a decision had already been made, though who's tone it is is
not clear. It certainly indicates an attitude favourable towards change. Even
so, William Mills, who had left in 1882, still returned annually to his old
Chapel, to deliver a sermon. Indeed, he was there in 1925 to join in the
centenary celebrations.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-right:.75pt"><font color="#000080">The
truth was that times were changing. As the anonymous writer would have
recognised, the Church was active; Sunday School, Band of Hope, Templar Lodge,
tract distribution, sick visiting, sewing classes, clothing club and
“manifold, unknown and unrecorded ways.” However, many of these were far
from new ventures. The Church faced “more subtle difficulties” in a
“pleasure loving and distracting age.” (BlB3) Whence the Church in the
twentieth century was a bigger question than the worthiness of a pastor.</font></p>

demonstrated <a href="Staltons&#32;House.htm">in the attached image</a> - the

The second part shows, with reference numbers, that part in the hands of Cha.
Good in 1757.&nbsp; The third part is part of the 1729 survey map in which the
reference numbers tally with the High Street property No 38.&nbsp; Incidentally,
there is the indication that a century before <a href="../TheCross.htm#huggett">Huggett's

&quot;Little Ease&quot; - a medieval term for a stocks or, more likely, a chamber offering little comfort

this chamber used as an <a href="../Articles/Law_and_order.htm">instrument of
feudal punishment and torture</a>.&nbsp; It would have been well sited, being
near the path from the village centre to the pre-inclosure northern field
(Nether Field) so that most villagers, on their dutiful way to or from working
in the field, could see the unfortunate 'ill-doer' receiving his/her punishment.</font></p>
