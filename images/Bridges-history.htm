M300/NRO </b>Notes by Wm. Taylor
of Heyford c.1718 for Bridges' History of Northamptonshire<br>
(<a href="M300.pdf">transcribed in entirety here</a>)</font></p>
<p align="center" style="padding-left: 10; padding-right: 10; padding-bottom: 15"><font color="#000000">In
order to collect information about the County, Bridges commissioned William
Taylor of Heyford to visit each Parish and elicit answers to a set of
questions.&nbsp; In this book, or part book, the questions are numbered 2.1 to
2.9 in a rather modern decimal manner.&nbsp; To one question the answer is
&quot;Nihil&quot; ie. none, so it was necessary to inspect reports at other
Parishes to discover what was that particular question.&nbsp; There were
presumably other books dealing with issues that Taylor would have numbered
1.1,&nbsp; 1.2, etc. but there is no trace.</font>
<p align="center" style="padding-left: 10; padding-right: 10; padding-bottom: 0"><font color="#000000"><b>In the columns below, Taylor's
tabulation is reproduced with comments and links alongside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

has been abandoned.</b></font>
