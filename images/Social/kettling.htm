      <td width="866" height="82"><font SIZE="3" color="#000080">The practice of
        drumming (or kettling, lowbelling &amp;c.) was a traditional one laid on
        for a pair of consenting individuals who “went outside the realms of
        decency” (this was Walter Alexander’s phrase in his memoirs,
        unpublished but archived at the N.R.O.) whereby
        for three days, in the evening, the villagers would gather and rattle
        tins and any pots from the kitchen outside the offender’s house. Going
        by the reported preparations in the first incident mentioned below, on
        the third night an effigy would be set alight. The process usually
        induced a return to decent morals or the person(s) leaving the village.
        There are two such incidents that are documented for Blisworth - no
        doubt, in the early times there were many more.</font>
        <p><font SIZE="3" color="#000080">It is just as well the practice of
        drumming died out for, if pursued diligently, no one would get any
        sleep, ever, in Blisworth by the 1960’s and 1970’s. That drumming
        has died out is a clear illustration of our society’s drift away from
        the formality of the Victorians - and that is an understatement! Perhaps in the second of the two
        incidents, events were fuelled by &quot;b-minded&quot; crowd mischief or by
        a dislike of the
        individuals concerned.&nbsp; Not all in the crowd, far from it, were
        motivated by their moral indignation.</font></td>

        <font SIZE="3">
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>A Mob Dispersed by the Police</b>: On account of
        numerous rumours circulating in Blisworth and the neighbourhood with
        regard to certain alleged misconduct on the part of a prominent official
        with a married woman of the village, a representative of the
        &quot;Northampton Mercury&quot; visited Blisworth on Thursday evening
        and reports to the following effect:-</font></p>
        <p><i><font color="#000080">The inhabitants, from one end of the village
        to the other, were in an unusual state of excitement and evidently
        waiting in anticipation for something unusual to happen. Feeling ran
        high in the village in regard to what was supposed to be the
        misdemeanour of the pair mentioned above and it had been decided to make
        public this feeling by a three day kettle demonstration. This course of
        action was speedily decided upon, and it was agreed to amalgamate
        forces, collect all the available tin cans, trays, bells and other like
        utensils capable of emitting sounds more or less melodious and serenade
        the man in question in font of his house at the top end of the village.
        Two evenings during this week had been devoted to this interesting
        pastime and for a while - between the hours of seven and nine -
        Blisworth rang with hoots and yells to the accompaniment of the most
        extraordinary din. But it was left to Thursday evening for the
        serenaders to make their crowning move. In some mysterious part of the
        village, busy hands had been at work constructing effigies out of rags
        and straw and it was understood that these were meant to represent the
        alleged culprits; effigies to be burnt outside the houses of the
        prototypes.</font></i></p>
        <p><i><font color="#000080">Crowds from both Gayton, evidently the home
        of the woman, and Blisworth had joined and were preparing the
        demonstration. They were halted by Constable Norman and Inspector
        Andrews who rather suddenly appeared upon the scene and who were able to explain that
        the allegations had been trumped up. They had interviewed witnesses to
        the supposed scandal in Gayton and by other information they were able
        to satisfy themselves there was nothing to be so excited about. The
        police prevailed upon the crowds which dispersed and allowed the village
        to revert to a calm state.</font></i><p><font color="#000080">In the
        opinion of one of Geo. Freeston's interviewees - W Alexander, the
        prominent official was in fact <u>the village bobby</u>.&nbsp; On the
        Alexander tape he cited three, not two, village events (as listed here)
        but gave insufficient details to be able to include the third here.</font></font></td>

        <p><font color="#000080">The police would try to disperse the gathering,
        as they did so on the last occasion of this sort in 1936, but the noise
        makers outside the man's house simply reconvened on private land nearby,
        being a farmer's
        field near enough for the noise to continue to have some effect. The
        police tried to get the farmer to move them off but he declined to
        become involved - the police could then only watch.&nbsp; Anyway, the
        police managed to dissuade those with the effigy to not set it
        alight.&nbsp; One or two people
        recall the 1936 incident and remember the use of all the old lard tins
        that had been previously discarded on a plot adjacent to the bacon
        factory.&nbsp; For legal reasons (unfortunately . . .) the apparent
        veracity of the story cannot be enhanced by the crude device of naming
        the poor man or the house, or the field!</font></font></td>
