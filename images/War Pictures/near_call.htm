        bonus school holiday came after the first bomb fell on the village.&nbsp;
        [one may think this wrong, initially, but schools were kept open through
        the holidays to ease family arrangements at the time]&nbsp; On August
        20th 1940, a 250 lb high explosive bomb fell on the Courteenhall Road
        just outside the school main gate - it did not explode but made a crater
        in which part of it could be seen ... The 'hole' was discovered when two
        men walking down the road in the dark on their way to work almost fell
        into the hole ... (I would love to know what they said to each other?).
        Having raised the alarm the area was evacuated, and a six-foot high sand
        bag wall was erected around the crater. There was one touch of comedy
        however, for it was reported that the two Wardens on duty had spent the
        night on the village seat under the Elm Tree nearby, but swore that they
        never heard the bomb drop within a few yards of where they were sitting
        (or sleeping?) 'Good old Dad's Army'... but how lucky they were ... The
        bomb was duly taken away and exploded in the local stone pits.</font></span>
