        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">
        As a child of 10 in September 1939 memories do return to me - hearing Hitler on wireless for the first time in the bottom shop of the Garage where Ron had his wireless and bicycle business.  This was some time prewar, from then on Hitler was always in the background, a shadowy persistent menace as also the bombs bursting on Madrid in the cinema.  Both the wireless and the Movietone and Pathe news brought his emotional violence and the delirious approval of his audiences. Constant harangues;
        Danzig, the Polish corridor, Czechoslovakia, Lebensraum, Deutschland, 'I
        have no more territorial demands' were his themes.  How wonderful we thought later to hear Churchill address him as Mr.
        Shicklegruber.

        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b> Sunday September 3rd
        1939</b> - we declare war on Germany.&nbsp; Our elders rarely mentioned the Great
        War (WWI), but it was there - Mrs. Frank Freeston’s distress was strange but real as she walked away through the garden
        on that Sunday when realisation struck home.  First knowledge came from an Uncle’s bookshelf in a hidden corner, a far away unimaginable world best forgotten.<br>
        My father was on relief work on that Sunday.  We fled, my mother and my sister and I, to hear Chamberlain in the comforting safety of the Garage
        parlour.</font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">The news was mostly of the sea.  The sinking of the Athenia and the aircraft carrier Courageous and the battleship Royal Oak was bad but our spirits were soon restored by the stirring stories of the merchant cruisers Rawalpindi and Jervis Bay both facing overwhelming odds.  Then there was news of the Graf
        Spee, Exeter, Achilles and Ajax.  The cinema shots of the end of Graf Spee with the thrilling news later of the rescue of her merchant navy prisoners from the supply ship Altmark by the destroyer Cossack.

        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">The cry ‘The Navy’s Here’ with which the crew of the Cossack greeted the prisoners as their hatch was opened was a catchword among the village boys for some time.  All
        this was very &quot;Boys Own Magazine&quot; adventure, where the
        magazine no longer seemed to be larger than life - the invasion of Denmark and Norway was, at first,
        a continuation of the adventures.

        sky - the day of the start of Hitler's Blitzkreig invasion of Holland,
        Belgium, Luxembourg and France. There was a sense of my mother’s apprehension as we sat alone in a compartment of the local train on the way to Northampton.  This soon increased the next week as the Daily Express arrived with maps of Northern France showing big pincer arrows.  The adults remembered the memories of their parents and a preceding battle at Sedan in the Franco-Prussian war.

        The month brought the daily score of downed German planes.  Then a bomb outside the council school guarded by a soldier,
        probably an L.D.V. (Local Defense Volunteer).  At about the same time a Dornier Flying Pencil
        <a href="../Articles/War-Years-I.html"> machine-gunned the
        station</a>.  The bullets pock marked the walls by the offices but no window was broken.  Sheila Stratton was pushing my young cousin Edwin in his pram up the Gayton road.
        She didn't take shelter but ran all the way home.  Home was safety to all of us.  This particular Dornier was said to have been shot down later near Cambridge.  Telegraph posts were placed in the field to the east of Stoke Road just to the south of the Knock Lane junction to stop gliders from landing.  This may have been about this time.

        The Blitz</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheltering with Mum and sister Sheila under the dining room table.  Dad was often away on relief duty on the railway.  The distinct wavering whine of the German unsynchronised engines were a dread as we waited for them to pass.  We heard the loud explosion of the landmines at Pury End.  There were bright parachute flares towards Northampton on the evening of 25th October.   There was Coventry glowing on the horizon early at 8o/c on the 14th of November.  Memorable was the relief at the ‘All Clear’ siren and contentment and security coming with the light of dawn.  There was the glow from London just visible on the night of the fire-raid at the end of January.  The whistle of a bomb heard for the first
        time, and the only time, on the night of 8th/9th of April.  Some of these bombs were delayed action and they started going off about eight in the morning.  Mother and father had to struggle to get their weary children out of bed.  Apparently it was all right in daylight.

        </b>The Blenheim in the calendar entry dated 09/11/41 is
        well remembered. The crash site was a little way up the track beside the
        Stone Works house in Stoke Road. Rumour had it that it was returning
        from a raid but that is probably doubtful. The crew as I recollect were
        unharmed. There were quite a few people standing around the burning
        plane, a bit like bonfire night although it was in the morning. The 303
        ammunition was exploding like fireworks but harmlessly of course as it
        was not being fired from a machine gun.

        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40"><font color="#000080">The Wellington, which crashed 25/08/43, was just over the boundary into
        Roade parish. It had crashed in a flat field on the SW side of Knock
        Lane and slid through both roadside hedges and come to rest a few yards
        into the field on the NE side. Our family were returning from a day out
        in London and probably because the train was bound for Northampton had
        decided to walk home from Roade when we first became aware of the
        incident. Next day of course small boys were in attendance. The R.A.F.
        were in attendance. There are two memories one of the bomb aimer coming
        back to rescue his bombsite and another of one of the Guards throwing a
        bunch of bomb safety keys to the crowd hoping no doubt they would then
        go away.

        The Rothersthorpe Wellington of 05/04/44 was altogether more tragic
        spinning out of control from cloud where the trainee pilot had probably
        failed to cope with flying blind and killing all the crew. We were just
        finishing our lunch when the loud crash came. The china on the sideboard
        went up and came down again. Boys being what they are we were off on our
        bikes but were subdued when we saw the smoking hole and worse.
        Rothersthorpe had a remarkable escape - the main part of the plane being
        not far from the houses and I believe the front turret just outside the
        school some distance away.

        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40"><font color="#000080">The Hadrian Glider at Tiffield on 07/07/44 was also tragic. We were not
        on the scene of that one but American soldiers were killed there. There
        was a story of one of the lads there taking the wrist watch off a dead
        soldier and being made to replace it by the adults. A Wellington that
        crashed at Tiffield 08/06/43 shed a propeller that was found by Donald
        Miller, I believe, in a hedgerow. It was a prized possession for some
        time but I think eventually it was reclaimed by the R.A.F.

        The sound of aircraft engines was nearly always present. Yellow Tiger
        Moths and Harvard trainers all the time.  Avro Ansons also called ‘Faithful
        Annies’ were seen a lot as was the Airspeed Oxford.  The Harvard had a very harsh and loud exhaust.  Wellingtons from the OTUs
        (Operational Training Units) were also plentiful.  Remembered was looking down
        from Gayton road on a Wellington which was flying very low just above the canal.  The top of a Wellington was quite a rare sight.  Many airmen died in these training planes.  My father was often distressed at the number of coffins sent from Northampton Castle Station.

        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">Later, the advent of the Stirling, Lancaster and Halifax four-engine heavy bombers transformed the skies some evenings.  Stirlings were soon dropped from the raids over Germany and used in secondary rolls such as glider tugs.  The Lancasters based in Lincolnshire were often evident.  The bomber stream was quite wide as it passed over with the aircraft quite far apart from one another.  The Halifaxs based further north in Yorkshire were not so often seen but I do remember one evening having cycled through Roade and halted on the railway bridge on the Ashton road seeing an impressive stream of Halifaxs flying in a southerly direction under a grey sky.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">One day while playing tennis at the Rectory (the old Rectory now) more than half a dozen Lancaster’s passed very low just clearing the trees.  This was not how Lancasters flew normally and they well may have been part of the Dam Buster squadron on a low-level practice flight.&nbsp;
        The American 8th air-force was based further east but at about eight o’clock  one morning a box of Fortresses came over.  There were 300 to 350 of them flying high all making condensation trails with their silver wings glinting in the sun.  They were high but the noise was memorable.&nbsp;
        Before D. Day, Dakotas towing gliders became another feature.  A train of these passed low directly over Blisworth just prior to D. Day, probably following the railway south.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">Another subject connected with the USAAF and Blisworth was a box of .5 in. ammunition jettisoned from a fortress presumably in trouble returning from a mission and found by the local boys.  Now the smaller British .303 in. was already familiar to them being acquired from various sources.  Bill Freeston at the garage showed wisdom in choosing to follow the course of instructing them how safely to put the round in a vice, remove the bullet with a pair of pliers, empty the cordite sticks and then tap the percussion cap with a punch and small hammer.  This of course expended itself with a satisfying crack and no harm was done.  We were especially warned not to attempt to do this with tracer bullets marked with red at the tip.  This we never did and no one came to harm.  Left to ourselves there may well have been a less happy outcome.  The American .5 in. round would have been even more lethal but we followed the same procedure in extracting the American filling, which was in the form of dark grey crystals.  However the authorities in the village inevitably became aware of the existence in their midst of this illegal treasure and some one grassed on the existence of the ammunition box, by this time I expect
        it was empty.  The headmaster, Mr. Cole, demanded the surrender of the box but this embarrassment was hastily disposed of in the canal and no more was heard of the matter.  On
        V.E. Day most of the American cordite was made into heaps and set alight by long trails of British cordite sticks.  That was a suitable celebration, we felt.  By
        V J night there was probably none left.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">A much more lethal weapon which was fortunately limited by lack of supplies was made by placing a quantity of water and carbide, left over from a previous era for lighting vehicle lamps, in a bottle with a screw top.  The result was very impressive and it was decided that this experiment must be abandoned.  To put these matters in perspective it must be remembered that we had been given demonstrations by the Home Guard of such things as mortar bombs - which had been terrifying.  They were playing too, weren’t they?<br>
        <br>
        The manoevres in the spring of 1943 were a highlight in the war for the boys among which there were no casualties.
        The Canadian tanks that came through the parish lost several soldiers in a tank that went blind through a hedge between Gayton and the cross roads and fell into a field that years before had been excavated for iron ore.  A dispatch rider lost a leg in Church Lane (then still ‘The Alley’) when his motorcycle became trapped between a gun carriage and the towing lorry.  Mrs Clinch of Blisworth House herself a Canadian took him into Northampton General Hospital in her car.  The unfortunate man’s screams and a large bloodstain in the road was a reminder that this was not all play for them.  Part of it was though.  Mrs Colson of ‘The Bays’ in Gayton Road watched a tank go straight through her hen house.  Turning to a nearby Canadian Major she asked him if that was really necessary, rather tartly I should imagine.  The Major replied ‘No madam, I should swear like hell if I was you’.  What ensued after that is not recorded.  Tony
        Newcombe, not very old at the time, remembers seeing the tank come through the hedge of Gayton Road into the field opposite his house and claims the damage is still discernable.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">More exciting still was when the village was shot up by
        300mph Spitfires that were dropping flour bags from wing mounted bomb
        racks.  A Bren carrier was hidden under the elm tree that then stood by our house - ‘The Nook’ in Church Lane.  A flour bag ‘exploded’ next to it so it should have been recorded as ‘written off’.  The Spitfires came extremely low just above the rooftops.  Anything was allowable then.<br>
        The soldiers came to the houses asking for baths for which permission was usually gladly given.  In exchange they left tins of corned beef, then a luxury item to civilians if not the military.  The main Towcester Road was left ruined from the tank tracks, difficult to cycle on at all.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">
        The cinema at Towcester that was built by Lord Hesketh for Lady Hesketh, to encourage her to go out, was a very modern cinema and the town and surrounding villages were very fortunate to have it.  It was often necessary to cycle there in the blackout with a cycle lamp with a slitted mask which didn’t light up much in front.  We were much more aware of the stars and the phases of the moon then and flashlights were an important part of our lives.  Films remembered starting with ‘Over the Rainbow’
        with Judy Garland and later with Micky Rooney was a great
        favourite, as was George Formby, Will Hay, Arthur Askey etc.  On a more serious theme were ‘Mrs.
        Miniver”, ‘The Way to the Stars’, Target for Tonight’, and all the other films of the period, lightened by the likes of Carmen Miranda, Bob Hope, and Dorothy
        Lamour.  Westerns and gangster films were still favourites with the boys but had to share their popularity with contemporary wartime films.  These films seen on a small screen in the comfort of one’s own home now never seem to have the same impact.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">The village did not have official evacuees because of the lack of piped water and a proper sewage connection but we had quite a few unofficial ones.  I remember John Bennet from Ilford stayed at Asplin’s farm.  Manfred Eisenhart who many years later visited George
        Freeston, lived with Mrs. Pinfold whose daughter Selina married a Polish refugee later.  Jan Hartog came to England by small boat I believe after a life on the run in Holland to avoid deportation to Germany as a forced
        labourer.  Victor Loveday stayed with the Cowley’s who kept the butchers shop.  Another Mrs. Bennet who I think was Mr. Chapman’s daughter from Manchester was at Victoria House with her two daughters Jean and her baby sister.
        <a href="../Lyrical/christmas_story.htm">Victoria House was (I believe but am not sure)</a> the refuge for a very short time of an arrested Canadian soldier who had escaped from a train.  Some of the boys from Holloway School in London lived in the village for a time.  Towcester Grammar School was loaned to them part time.<br>
        <br>
        Winston Churchill came through Towcester in the election campaign of 1945.  The car in which he travelled came by the Grammar School and all the pupils lined the roadside.  I remember some of the boys whose families would certainly be voting for Attlee were the most vociferous in their welcome.  This was the first presentiment of post war Britain.  Churchill’s complexion I remember clearly was flour white.  Only one more memory remains and that is the great shock the exploding of the atom bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused.  This was perhaps even more shocking than the news of the German extermination camps.

        <p class="MsoTitle" align="left"><font color="#000080">Looking further back, the ringing of the Blisworth Church bells in celebration of
        &quot;Alamein&quot; - when Rommel's North African Corps was put to
        flight, being the first great Allied victory - was a pleasanter and  abiding recollection.<br>
