<p>A 1944 leaflet reminding citizens of the value in saving scrap and recycling
as much as humanly<br>
possible.&nbsp; So far, the only documented incidences of scrap metal collection
are the removal of the<br>
fences outside the four cottages in Chapel Lane and a similar removal of part of
the fence around<br>
the front of the school - the latter in 1943.<br>
The measures and preparation of materials for collection puts our feeble efforts
to recycle in our<br>
current circumstances in a new light.&nbsp; However, the 1940s efforts went off
&quot;half-cocked&quot; because<br>
the majority of the scrap metal was unsuitable and had to be dumped in the North
Sea.</p>
