        The thorough-going book &quot;The Natural History of Northamptonshire&quot;,
        1712 by John Morton, BA Oxon and advisor to Queen Anne, includes the
        conclusion there is no mineral interests, esp. iron, in the County of
        Northamptonshire.&nbsp; He does however cite a number of types of
        limestone and many limestone quarries at places such as Collyweston,
        Roade, Gretton, Helmdon and Welden.&nbsp; Also a sand-coloured stone
        quarry near Eydon.&nbsp; His review sometimes extends beyond the County
        border as he mentions the heaps of slag left by presumed Saxon
        ironworkers near Gretton and Corbei (Corby!) and the 17th century
        attempts to work some more iron out of it.&nbsp; The ore was evidently
        not as rich as that in the Forest of Dean where slag was been re-worked
        to good profit.&nbsp; Morton described ferruginous limestones in
        Northamptonshire, near Northampton and Desborough, that have a
        pronounced rust colour and may contain a dark iron marcasite.&nbsp; He
        described the stone with fissures and frequent cavities full of ochrous
        sand and it is obvious, to the present reader, he was describing
        'ironstone'.&nbsp; He said that the locals referred to it as ironstone
        on account of its hardness and its weight (elsewhere referring to a
        specific gravity of up to 3.1) but he cautions &quot;this is erroneous
        for there is very little iron in it.&quot;&nbsp; He described the result
        of an experiment to extract iron - obtaining only one grain from a pound
        of ore (0.02% by weight).&nbsp; All this seems to suggest that iron
        extraction technology had been widely forgotten since the Saxons and is
        a reminder to not use available technology as though it were capable of
        telling the whole story.</font>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>Earliest Records</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The earliest reference to quarrying potential in the parish is dated
        1718 - &quot;<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><i>in

        </span>Stone&quot;</i> </span> (see below).&nbsp; Geo. Freeston found a reference, now lost, to a
        claim that Blisworth Church was built of local stone, which would
        indicate 13 and 14th Century quarrying but this cannot be pinned to any
        particular location.&nbsp; The Church tower uses some heavy iron-bearing
        limestone which has weathered very non-uniformly.&nbsp; Some has
        weathered hardly at all and such robust material would be worthy of smelting, being
        a high-grade iron ore.&nbsp; The Romans established iron extraction at
        Duston and Hunsbury so it would probably have been known at the time of
        building and then forgotten, and re-forgotten, that some local stone
        contained iron.&nbsp; The iron would be irrelevant to the early builder
        because the stone was much harder than the limestone and could be used
        in places where strength was paramount.</font>

        <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;The parish is crossed from
        west to east by a
        pathway known as the <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"> Saltway
        </span>that was used in Roman times.
        Another path, the Oxenford Way running approximately north to south, borders the parish on the Tiffield side and
        is said to relate to Saxon trading across Mercia.&nbsp; These paths pass
        close to quarrying sites known in recent times.&nbsp; Because a stone might have been revealed
        at these sites as an outcrop in the terrain,
        some may have begun as a quarry many centuries ago.</font>

        search for a clue</b>: the fact that many of the oldest cottages in Blisworth are built mostly of
        ironstone suggests a <i>significant</i> local availability in the 16 or 17th
        Centuries, this without having to dig
        under a thick overburden of limestone.&nbsp; Such stone may have been taken from places
        where the
        ironstone virtually outcrops.<br>
        <img height="190" src="goodesbush.jpg" width="300" align="left">
        A roam around the parish reveals no substantial hollows indicative of an
        ironstone quarry.&nbsp; There is one contender; &quot;Fox Covert&quot;
        in the field below Hill Farm on the Gayton Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;This wooded
        area is given in Bryant's 1827 map, see inset, as &quot;Goodes
        Bushes&quot; which implies that if it once included a quarry then it was
        worked out in the 18th century or before that.&nbsp; In fact the Goode
        family rented an adjoining area from the Duke of Grafton and Goodes
        Bushes, including Fox Covert, was kept 'in-hand', being deemed
        unworkable.&nbsp; In more recent maps Fox Covert is shown embedded in a field and not contiguous with the road
        and, in the (</span><a href="Mining-Map.htm">MAP</a><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">)
        used here to explain the mainly Victorian mining, it is clear that the
        majority of the whole field was mined by Bevan from 1897 to 1913 (see
        below).&nbsp; Fox Covert at present is not hollowed out at all; it used to
        have a depth of 3 to 5 feet but has been filled with rough soil &amp;c.
        by the present farmer over the past 40 years.&nbsp; The depth of the
        over-burden handled by the Victorians was also 3 to 5 feet and this
        explains the depth of Fox Covert after mining was finished.&nbsp; The
        drop in field level below the road varies widely between 3 and 10 feet
        and so it could be that the original quarry hollow that was included in Goodes
        Bushes was deep, 6 to 15 feet or even more including the over-burden.&nbsp; This could
        therefore have been the source of Blisworth's substantial blocks of
        ironstone, ie. red stone, that were used for building.&nbsp; The area
        and depths considered could have amounted, in theory, to over 10000
        cubic-metres of stone, enough to serve the village.&nbsp; The field is generally
        sloped at 1 : 10 or 1 : 15 as far down as the Covert but takes on a
        much steeper slope below that, as far down as the stream.&nbsp; The
        slope change probably marks the transition from ironstone to blue clay.&nbsp;
        The ironstone might have originally outcropped at that transition.</span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><font color="#000080"><br>

        <a name="arbutt"></a>Alternatively an intriguing story might emerge
        from an ongoing interest in the mention of an &quot;Arbutt Lane&quot;
        leading from Blisworth towards Gayton and an Arbutt Pond in Bryant's
        map, as shown in the previous inset, and the fact
        there was a spinney in Gayton named Harpett's (phonetically similar)
        which descended to a hollow containing a pond.&nbsp; The name Harpett does not
        apparently go back
        further than early 19th Century (from&nbsp;Gayton records of R. Poxon there is record of the name
        there in 18th century - it was Arm Pit!) but the area is clearly an
        ancient works some quarter mile long which has had the limestone removed by
        glacial action making the now extracted ironstone, ie. red stone, available at the surface.&nbsp; It
        is one mile from Blisworth.&nbsp; It is hoped that research will
        demonstrate this name Harpett or Arbutt
        originated in, for example, Hard Pitt (see cream area in the inset) or somesuch name for a quarry -
        'Arm Pit' does not
        sound right.&nbsp; The area near to the late (filled in 1950s) pond is
        known as Britain or Little Brittain.&nbsp; No-one knows why it has this
        name or can suggest a plausible reason for it having any specific name
        at all. Perhaps there was once a cross-roads there for the Oxenford Way,
        or a 'braid' of that path.<a name="pits"></a>&nbsp; Incidentally, the
        pool seems to be at one end of the old quarry and might be quite ancient
        as suggested by Mrs. R Poxon.</font></span></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><font color="#000080">Worthy of brief mention are the ancient works
        once defined by crop marks to the northwest of the village in fields
        originally known as The Loundes.&nbsp; The region is coloured light pink
        and marked 100BC in the (<a href="Mining-Map.htm">MAP</a>) because the Northampton County Monuments Records suggests
        this age.&nbsp; Also is offered the opinion they might be clay or stone workings,
        thus some form of early mining, or be simply enclosures.&nbsp; The <a href="../loundes.htm#cropmarks">overlapping
        circle</a> impression is curious anyway.&nbsp; It does not seem too far
        fetched to suppose that, while the site suggests a 100BC age, it was
        visited by house-builders for &quot;red stone&quot; who got what they
        were after without 'modernising' the look of the site.&nbsp; The site is
        similarly positioned near a rock-clay transition, as in the case of the
        Fox Covert site discussed above.&nbsp; The diameters of the features
        seem far to big to be the remains of iron extraction 'furnaces'.&nbsp;
        Evidently, a little ground investigation has been done; Mona Clinch in
        her 1938 book on the village gives the following account.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;<i>Curious
        Pits noted at Blisworth during ironstone workings (July 1886). In the
        ironstone workings ' little pits ' are commonly met with. They are a few
        feet in diameter, and seem to have been built from the exterior, as the
        lining stonework is better and smoother on the outside than the inside;
        also, there is a space outside filled in with rubble. The peculiar
        thing, however, is that they are all more or less choked with a quantity
        of bones of animals—horse, ox, pig, dog, red deer, etc., perhaps, and
        some pottery. The pits were not large enough for the animals to have
        been put in whole. Mr. T. J. George collected some bones (as I did also)
        and some pottery. Also Roman coins were found in the near neighbourhood,
        and the opinion formed was that the pits themselves might be dated as of
        Roman times.&nbsp; Since the period above named, 1886, much ironstone
        has been got, but I have not heard of other similar pits being found, so
        they must have occupied rather a limited area. Perhaps the pits were
        water wells originally, but this is by no means certain. Ultimately they
        appear to have been refuse pits only. Beeby Thompson F.C.S., F.G.S.,
        assumes the pits to be of Roman origin, it is interesting to note that
        several fragments of Roman pottery were found in nearby Stockwell field
        during well sinking operations in 1928.</i></font></p>

        the limestone.&nbsp; In the 20th century the quarry is known as Rectory

      <td width="830" height="57"><font color="#000080"><b>1805</b>&nbsp; This
        is the date of the inclosure award map although a few fields were not
        inclosed until c.1840 and a large number such as Slatpitt were
        inclosed a hundred years earlier.&nbsp; The award document refers to three field areas each of about one
        acre that were &quot;<i>reserved for the continued extraction of
        stone</i>&quot; implying they had already been established as quarries for a
        period of time.&nbsp; Two pieces are near a parish boundary and sited to the furthest

        after his rented-out cottages only to the extent of thatching and
        replacing window glass.&nbsp; Pointing and wall repairs and anything

      <td width="830" height="57"><font color="#000080"><b>1820/1</b>&nbsp; Well
        documented by Geo. Freeston is the instruction in 1820 by the Duke to
        his agent John Roper to take an expert and go round the parish and find
        a potential quarry site that might be developed for selling good
        quality stone.&nbsp; John Roper then established the quarry towards the
        east of the parish, labelled &quot;The Stone Works 1821 to 1920&quot; in
        the (<a href="Mining-Map.htm">MAP</a>).&nbsp; This 'new' quarry was
        contiguous with the quarry already opened probably well before 1800 and
        it seems likely that most of the 'research' would have been done at the
        bar in the Duke of Grafton's Arms.&nbsp; As strongly suggested by
        the <a href="../Articles/Stone-works.html">article on the stoneworks</a>,
        it is likely that the Duke was unaware that John Roper was already
        running that quarry and taking a large share of the income from
        it.&nbsp; The date 1820 thus points to the start of an <i>open</i>
        commercial availability of stone from Blisworth rather than to the start
        of that particular quarrying area.&nbsp; Maybe the tenants
        mentioned in the previous paragraph had to pay the

        delivered to various inland ports.&nbsp; Late in the life of the quarry,
        the stone was mainly carried to
        the Hunsbury iron works, using the Northampton Arm canal, as a flux in the

        got through to the Duke since, at the 1851 Exhibition in the London
        Crystal Palace,
        Northamptonshire landowners advertised their potential value in terms of iron
        deposits.&nbsp; John Morton's view of things was being revised (see
        opening paragraph). This of course sent a flurry of surveyors back to the
        County to find the all important coal to go with the iron ore.&nbsp;
        They were not lucky.&nbsp; By the mid-1850s there were tests being
        carried out on the ore from various places to see how smelting
        conditions needed to be adjusted in view of the main contaminants in the
        ore.&nbsp; Regular extraction by 1852 was established at the site next
        to the turnpike labelled (5) in
        the (<a href="Mining-Map.htm">MAP</a>) by partners Clare and Hickman and from 1860 there was
        better organised opencast mining extending across the fields to the east and north of the
        village linked by a horse railway to the dispatch point labelled (6) in
        the map.&nbsp; The same partners began the mining in these eastern fields earlier
        than 1860 but there is no record of the exact location.&nbsp; They lobbied unsuccessfully for
        a connection with the railway and then gave way in 1854 to Mr. W.
        Arundell who established some sort of dispatch point at (6).&nbsp; In 1859
        Arundell failed and the mining agreement was then won by G.E.Bevan and
        Company, already established at Duston, who mechanised the project more
        successfully and developed the dispatch point at (6) into a more
        workable scheme.</font>
        <p><font color="#000080">Also in Gayton parish mining made an early
        start in 1850s with George Pell (who later gained fame in owning blast
        furnaces) and it is evident he began in &quot;Britain&quot;, a location
        mentioned above, with a tramway and an overhead loading gantry
        communicating with a field to the south-east. With the building of the SMJ
        railway line, that field (<a href="../Development/Review/area_sp7154.htm">shown
        here</a>) was cut off and so the gantry had to be rebuilt to also cross the
        railway cutting. Pell's tramway that originally descended to sidings by
        the Birmingham-London main line had to be rerouted to make room for the
        SMJ line. Pell's site and gantry was later taken over by Wheldon and the
        tramway running to the south-east was taken under the road to the south
        to service even more extensive surface mining c. 1895 to 1910.</font>
        <p><font color="#000080">The <a href="../mills-blisworth.htm">windmill was not in
        use after 1882</a> and the ground there would have been lowered by at
        least ten
        feet as it was over a considerable area known as Blisworth Pit No. 1.&nbsp;
        The pink arrow extending towards the village, shown in the map, represents an
        opportunist claim for more ironstone in 1912 -13 just before the new
        school was built at the road junction.&nbsp; There was another
        relatively late incursion labelled 1910 near to the brake-drum.&nbsp;
        This appeared set to mine out the remainder of the allotment field but,
        fortunately for <a href="../aerialviews.htm#greenside"> today's
        allotmenters</a>, it was halted by failed
        economics.&nbsp; A group of wagons were left in a deep cut that still
        exists amongst the allotments.&nbsp; The wagons are shown in the first
        picture on <a href="../Ironston-part1.htm">ironstone, Part I</a>.&nbsp;
        There is an interesting data set in Mona Clinch's 1938 book giving <a href="beds.htm">thicknesses
        and descriptions of limestone strata</a> presumably from workers' memory
        at the close of limestone quarrying operations - the emphasis is upon
        limestone.</font>
        <p><font color="#000080">The dispatch point (6) for this <a href="../Ironston-part1.htm">complex
        of fields, 'ironstone Part I'</a>, in fact consisted of <a href="../Ironstonbr.htm">a bridge
        over the canal</a> with a large hole in it.&nbsp; Wagons were lowered
        onto the bridge and tipped up by winch so that the contents emptied into wooden coffers in
        narrow boats moored below the bridge.&nbsp; Bevan invented a <a href="../Ironstonbr.htm#drum">brake-drum</a> arrangement, marked 'd' in the (<a href="Mining-Map.htm">MAP</a>),
        to enable an empty wagon to be raised up the 1 in 5 grade from the
        bridge using the weight of a descending full wagon.&nbsp; This required
        some ingenuity and a suggestion for how it was done is indicated in the
        box below with the diagram showing how the wagons were marshalled.&nbsp;Note that the railway passes under
        the Stoke Road through a short 'subway', as it was called in those
        days.&nbsp; The ore was either taken to railway sidings by the
        station to be conveyed to South Wales or Nottinghamshire or taken down
        the Northampton Arm canal to Hunsbury iron works which housed a couple
        of blast furnaces run by the Phipps family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

        public houses some years before that!). With the start of WWI, some reports say in 1912, the furnaces at Hunsbury were closed down through lack of men and were
        not restarted after the war for lack of men, money and horses.&nbsp; No
        further mining was done in the eastern fields.&nbsp; There are two
        remaining stretches of mining gully; one in the allotment field and the
        other adjacent to the north side of the Courteenhall Road where the
        extraction of nearly 20 feet of ore is evidenced by the depth of a
        terminating gully.&nbsp; Noteworthy points are that the mining by Phipps
        after 1901 was carried out carefully with pathways from the Back Lane
        always kept open, once with a temporary bridge. However, the miners paid
        rent for only the strip in which they worked at any one time and they
        left a devastated area of subsoil for gardeners or the farmer to deal
        with. Rent appeared to be paid to the Parish Council and it therefore
        boosted the precept.</font>

        Incidently, mining was generally carried out to a
        well-defined plan that lead to the railway being repositioned
        progressively across a field, this is explained with the picture that
        follows the above-mentioned archive.&nbsp; The final layout of the

        would walk to Blisworth either every day or weekly and seek board in the
        already over-crowded cottages.&nbsp; In 1911 there was <a href="../Articles/village_house_famine.htm">a
        political row</a> when the Duke of Grafton was accused of providing
        insufficient houses for villagers.&nbsp; It was the local immigration of

        There were two other ironstone 'fields' in the parish run by Bevan.&nbsp; They were both to the west side of the parish, both
        dispatched at the canal at two specialised wharfs that are both labelled
        (7) in the (<a href="Mining-Map.htm">MAP</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;The southerly
        dispatch point was again a horse railway and it probably used ropes to
        help control the final descent towards the <a href="../Ironston-part1.htm#chute">chute
        over the canal that is pictured here</a>.&nbsp; The two successive pictures and the

        We have no trace of
        the northerly canal dispatch point; even the field boundary that is evident
        today that might have suggested the run of the railway was established afresh as recently as
        1967and is not aligned with the path of the railway.&nbsp;
        However, an 1890 OS map, shown here, provides a glimpse of the rail and
        wagon control arrangement which fed an off-load terminal probably very
        similar to the one mentioned in the previous paragraph.&nbsp; Halfway
        down the slope there is a rail crossover section.&nbsp; The logical
        reason for it to be placed just halfway is that a cable system was used
        to lift the empty wagon up the slope with the weight of a full wagon -
        just as at dispatch point (6).&nbsp; The person in charge of the
        changeovers appeared to have been accommodated in a hut with the luxury
        of a well.&nbsp; The precise way in which the signal post was used is
        obscure as is the manner in which the exchange of wagons was controlled.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">An intriguing 1950 OS map which carries

        that the above rail system used a winding drum.&nbsp; Note that evidently towards the end
        of the mining there was thought to be an additional rail spur extending eastwards
        from what is now the allotment field.&nbsp; Also, <b>two bridges</b>

        dispatch point to the railways, labelled (8), and was run by another
        entrepreneur, R.B.Sparrow according to Tonks, who was simultaneously serving the expanding iron
        industry.&nbsp; Dispatch point (8), which is in Gayton parish, consisted
        of a wooden 'bridge' passing over a standard gauge railway linked to the
        SMJ line.&nbsp; From the bridge, wagons were emptied into rail wagons.</font></p>

        During the war the call for an expanded iron industry was desperate.&nbsp;

        became evident that the ironstone on the west side of the village was
        covered by 10 to 15 feet of limestone.&nbsp; By the 1960s the limestone
        was being removed with one machine, the larger, and the ironstone with
        another.&nbsp; Villagers recall the all day <a href="../Ironston-part2.htm#grinding"> characteristic grinding</a>

        clay.&nbsp; The earlier mining fields on the east of the village had
        little or no limestone overburden.&nbsp; A glacial action must have
        scraped the limestone off.&nbsp; There is neither limestone nor
        ironstone in the valleys to the north of these high lands because
        glacial run off has presumably cleared it all away leaving, in some
