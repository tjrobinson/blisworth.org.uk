        <p align="center"><b>December 2006</b> - The name of
        the road in the new development, which will be adopted,<br>
        has been
        resolved.&nbsp; It is to be <b>LADYFIELD</b>, which recalls the history
        of a neighbouring field - see <a href="Articles/Fields&amp;Allotments.html">the
        Parish Fields</a>.<br>
        The name does not hint at the vendor of the land - that's
        rubbish.</p>
        <p><b>History:</b>&nbsp; Since c. 1500 there have been fields, or some
        small allotments within the medieval open fields, worked for an income
        dedicated to the provision of decorations in the church and a
        continuously burning light before a statue of <b> Our Lady</b> located in the
        Lady Chapel of the Church, close to the site of the Wake Tomb, see 43-00
        and 43-14 in the <a href="Church-Images1.htm">Church Images section.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At the time of the inclosures (c. 1815) the various pieces of land were
        condensed into one field and, at some point, this condensed field passed
        from church to County Council.&nbsp; The field in question is the
        neighbouring field to this development; in Victorian times it
        accommodated allotments.&nbsp; More recently it has been divided for
        allotments and for a community village playing field.</p>
  </center>
      <p align="left"><b>Comment:</b>&nbsp; The choice of the name is welcome.&nbsp;
      An alternative name was 'Quarry Road' to call attention to the fact that
      there was ironstone open-cast mining over this whole area in Victorian
      times - see linked map at the head of the <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Ironstone-part1.htm">Ironstone
      Section</a>.&nbsp; Other suggestions included Westley Road and Freeston
      Road but they were not favoured.</p>
      <p align="left">Remarkably, in November 1967, the name 'Lady Field' was
      proposed by the then Chairman of the Parish Council, Ms. Bellairs, for one
      of the roads now known as Windmill Avenue, Buttmead, Wellspring
      &amp;c.&nbsp; A procedural error occurred while the chairman was absent
      and the name was not given consideration.&nbsp; The then clerk for the
      Parish Council, George Freeston, had provided a list of historical field
      names they might consider.&nbsp; It has not been possible to find, on
      historical maps, any field once called Lady Field and it is possible that
      either George or Ms. Bellairs thought of it via a similar reasoning to
      that above . . . we will never know!&nbsp;</p>
