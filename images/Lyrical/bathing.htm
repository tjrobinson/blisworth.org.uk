</font></b>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">From the earliest recollections of the old men in the village there was a
bathing place on the canal just south of the first bend after the &quot;mill
straight&quot;. In recent years there has been a rope swing <i>opposite</i> the
place which was the main venue for all males during the summer months. It was
enjoyed right through to the second world war when, apart from the distraction
of the war, the increased use of motor propelled boats rendered the water
unpalatable.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">William Whitlock (now in his 85th year) tells of the large number of village
boys and men who would congregate at the spot during summer evenings. Few
families could afford a bathing costume and at the approach of a boat or some
pedestrians on the towpath opposite some bathers would enter the water and stay
decently submerged until the 'all clear' was given. It must be remembered that
at this time a large quota of the men came from the Westley Buildings [George
says this to be sure of explaining a point about the working classes - after
all, it was 1959].</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">After a long busy dusty day in the fields or the ironstone pits, the luxury
of a cool dip was irresistible - all took a towel and carbolic soap. The costumes
that there were were often ragged and perhaps improvised from string and a
handkerchief. I believe much hilarity and good natured ribaldry existed at these
male sessions and it wasn't unknown for 'peeping toms' to look through the hedge
opposite.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">The place was ideal for both young and old for there was a shelf on which the
youngsters would feel secure - provided they didn't stray too far. There were
pollarded willow trees nearby and the tufts of red underwater roots could be
held as youngsters learnt to swim - not that any boy dare admit he couldn't swim
for, if so, he was caught and with a 'one, two, three' he would be swung into
the water. &quot;Now's the time to bl.... well learn!&quot; Learn to swim we did
- or to the hesitant it was best to stay away. Swimming matches were held.
Although attempted, I understand that no-one has succeeded in swimming right
through the tunnel. [Such an attempt would be insane these days for fear of
meeting and being hit by a boat]</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">It is said that after a drinking session at the Sun, Moon and Stars some
men-folk would walk along the towpath and throw coins into the water for young
bathers to try and retrieve and the most skillful of them could collect a
worthwhile amount of money.&nbsp; Knowing that the bottom of the canal is muddy
makes this claim rather dubious!</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Occasionally the authorities would attempt to deter the bathers but by virtue
of the bathing place being well out of the village there seem to be little or no
record of complaints of immodesty. These days, any bathing is confined to near
Candle Bridge and is conducted with decorum but at some risk to health as the
water is becoming rather poor. [by 2000 the water was so poor, at least in the
summer, as to warrant a visit to the hospital after swallowing it]</font></p>
