by George Freeston</font></p>

During the early years of the 20th century,
the Parish Church at Blisworth enjoyed the organ playing by an ageing lady named
Lucy Perkins. Her husband was George Perkins the <a href="../Stokerd01.htm#perkins">village
butcher in Stoke Road</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Choirboys at Blisworth were much impressed by
her organ playing. Seated on a bench seat she seemed to slide to and fro to aid
her use of the organ pedals and she sang lustily to the tunes that she was
playing be it a hymn or a psalm. She also fitted the characteristics of her
playing to the words in an attempt to dramatise their meaning. Bass notes were
amplified for &quot;ye mountains&quot; and treble were given the equivalent
treatment for &quot;ye hills&quot; in the Psalm 114 passage - &quot;Ye mountains
skipped like rams, and ye little hills like lambs&quot; - and when the psalmist
said &quot;Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord&quot; the whole
organ body trembled.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">Lucy, on occasions, was called upon to help at
local churches if bereft of an organist.</font>&nbsp; <font size="3" color="#000080">One
such call came from Canons Ashby. Transport was provided by pony and trap driven
by her husband. On arrival she took her place at the organ in good time before
the service commenced. A little nervous she asked the verger on a 'point of
procedure', who stated that with the arrival of the squire, Sir Henry, she was
to play her Voluntary. To a further question she was given the description of
Sir Henry as &quot;short and grey-whiskered&quot;.&nbsp; In silence she watched
and waited until in came a gentleman fitting the description of the Squire - so,
with all confidence and &quot;all stops out&quot; the voluntary was commenced -
but - up trotted the verger loudly saying,</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">&quot;Stop, that's not him - that's the
rat-catcher!&quot;</font></p>

George Freeston said that many of the music scores were the handiwork of the cobbler, Mr Green, who was
also an organist and creative calligrapher.&nbsp; <a href="../Early&#32;Industry/john_green.htm">An
article</a> on his work and family at Blisworth is available on the website.</font></p>
