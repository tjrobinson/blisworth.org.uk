<p align="center"><b><font color="#000080" size="4">Edgar Thomas Ayres' Story as
told to George Freeston in c. 1965</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="#000080">(part of a transcription of
questions and answers that needed to be re-written)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">I was born on May 14th, 1892 and when I left
school, when aged fifteen, I went to work on the W H Smith bookstall at Blisworth Station.
Using boys, we used to send out to various people in the morning newspaper which
had arrived by train. Then I would travel by train myself to Towcester and
deliver to Easton Neston, Holcot, the Showsley cottages and the Pynus cottages
(see &quot;Pyesnest&quot; field name) -
all by walking. I started work at seven o'clock and stayed at the station stall
until about six o'clock.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">The main business was selling newspapers to
people coming off the trains because the station was very busy in the mornings.
Northampton people came in on the branch line and had to wait around for a main
line train - so they had a few minutes to get a newspaper. The Stratford line
carried quite a lot of people from as far away as the Broom <a href="edgar-ayres.htm#1">[1]</a>
junction. There
was another bookstall on the SMJ platform and that was run by <a href="../people-three.htm#bennett"> Mr
Bennett</a>. I had
the Wymans stall on the main line. The two of us were friendly and we walked
together by
the canal to and from work - he lived next to the Sun, Moon and Stars.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">I didn't deliver in Blisworth itself. I earned
three and six a week (17.5 pence) and that was considered a good wage in 1910.
As for walking, there wasn't much traffic on the roads - just a few horse and
carts and I seldom got offered a lift because the horses usually had enough to pull. It
was healthy work - plenty of fresh air.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080"><a name="ejector"></a>After twelve months of that I went into baking
in Blisworth with Mr T Sturgess in the Stoke Road and then I went on the Post
Office as a postal delivery man.</font></p>
<p><img height="502" src="e-ayres.jpg" width="300" align="left">
<font size="3" color="#000080">I would start at 5.45am finish at 12 and every
alternate Sunday night I had to attend to the <a href="../Articles/post_office_services.htm"> Mail Ejector
on the railway
bank</a> doing a dispatch at 10.10pm with a collection from Towcester and a receive
at 3.30am. That was a tough old job but I didn't mind it - the wind could blow
on the bank, yes, it was a struggle at times. The mail cart came up from
Towcester and I had to put the letters into some leather pouches. When mail is
received from a train it might be doing 60mph and the bag is caught in the net -
it never went wrong in my time!&nbsp;&nbsp; Local mail for Blisworth came in by train from
Northampton so it had already made the journey from the bank up into Northampton
where it was sorted.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">I took over from my father on the post. He had
done it for 35 years. His uniform was some blue trousers with a red stripe, a
scarlet three-quarter length coat with brass buttons and more stripes and with
all that a pillbox hat with a peak and a gold band around it. That was the correct
<a href="ayres.jpg">
&quot;mail messenger's&quot; uniform</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">I could get nervous on the dark nights up on
the bank. Once I had a shock when I saw a body against the signal. It was just a
ganger on his way home after he had been to the hotel. Well, he was 'three parts
in the wind' - old Jack Kirk who lived at Fogg Cottages on the parish boundary
with Courteenhall. Being the most direct way, he always walked along the line.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">When on the bank I stayed in a little hut <a href="edgar-ayres.htm#3">[3]</a>
with
no heating, no fire. I could always walk to the station to get warm again. I
would go past the hotel a see a few goings on.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080">As a child I went to the <a href="../Blisgardens.htm"> gardens behind the
hotel</a> a lot. We had some good parties at Bank Holidays and they put on some good
shows. there was a lovely lawn for dancing and a military band. It was a celebrated
gardens and many people came out from Northampton to the roller skate
rink and others things. If it was a Sunday school outing that was always held on
the (old) Rectory lawn. As I got older I could go up on the mail wagons to
Northampton. As teenagers there were three of us together - up to town at 5
o'clock and perhaps go to a performance at the theatre at the bottom of
Horsemarket <a href="edgar-ayres.htm#4">[4]</a>. Then we would come back by train at 10 o'clock
(the fair was 6d!) after
calling at a corner shop for a glass of ginger wine. It was a rear treat and it
wasn't intoxicating. I was in a temperance society <a href="edgar-ayres.htm#5">[5]</a> and
I never had a strong drink . . . .</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080"><a name="1"></a>[1]&nbsp; Broom Junction was
at the Stratford-on-Avon end of the line.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#000080"><a name="3"></a>[3]&nbsp; At first this was
thought to be the
hut in <a href="../Rails-three.htm">image <b>27-31</b></a> but we now know there
<a href="../Railways/Catcher/mailcatcher.htm">were huts actually up on the
embankment.</a></font></p>

<font color="#000080">Later in life Edgar (Eddie) Ayres became much <a href="../ch-groups.htm">involved
with the church</a> and<br>
is pictured here presiding over his church exhibition which appears to have<br>
some things in common with G Freeston's exhibitions (there are pages from<br>
