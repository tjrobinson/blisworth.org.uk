has added attribution and appended to the title.&nbsp; George's typing, perhaps
through<br>
hardware limitations, was generally not as clear of slips as this.&nbsp; Percy
Whitlock, who<br>
was related to the Blisworth <a href="../whitlock.htm">Whitlocks</a>, was a creative musician who spent time
at the<br>
organ of Blisworth church in his younger years.&nbsp; His biography has been
written by<br>

which, on page 206, reference is made to an unpublished work of<br>
circa 1940 - 1945, the manuscript having been lost.&nbsp; It appears the

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">I suppose that most people
approaching middle-age have in store memories of a chequered childhood - of days
of gloom and torment, days of idyllic and singing happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those early days seem to shine with a lustre of brilliant colour in
comparison with the time of the present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
even the light was brighter and the darkness more opaque - days more spacious
and full of adventure.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">Every year we used to visit
some remote cousins in Northamptonshire, and the thoughts of the coming holiday
would be spurred to fresh vigour as the actual preparations began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I always felt that there could be no possibility of rest the night
before, for my mind was agog with the anticipated joys of the morrow, but
somehow sleep descended on me, and I woke with a startled refreshment, realising
that the day had come at last, and all was sunny and serene.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">The journey to London was
uneventful, the occasional sight of unattainable green fields and copses but
serving to quicken my impatience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
was luggage, and tickets too, and it was not till we passed the imposing pillars
of Euston, and smelt again the well-remembered flavour of the station that one
felt really on holiday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The coaches
seemed more comfortable, they ran more smoothly, and as one moved out of the
mist of London into country which was at once strange but dimly remembered there
came that leap of the heart which betokened freedom and happiness.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">We changed at Bletchley of
course, everyone does sooner or later; and soon the stationmaster and his bell
warned us to stand back, for here our last train, taking us deeper and deeper
into the country to our destination. I think the next few moments, so repeated
yet so thrilling are among the most precious I possess: one came from the
station into an air so calm and pure that it was as if one had been silently
translated into a realm of crystal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
fragile stillness was itself an enchantment, and I turned my back on the
faithful train, and hastened away from the usually fascinating station-yard with
its shunting goods-wagons - these could wait till another day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So our panting train passed regretfully on - hurt perhaps at such patent
neglect, and I detached myself from my parents and the kind old man who had met
us, for no-one could be there to share just that flooding moment of childish
happiness.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">I went on ahead, passed the
hotel (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">1</a>), remote and still, covered with ivy, and hunted for fir-cones at the bases
of these welcoming giants which guarded the side of the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down the dusty way a little, then through a gate and down a little rough
path to the towing path (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">2</a>) where we had to go something like half a mile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This long distance was all too short, even for my childish feet, for my
heart was all a-bustle and little songs came and went - songs with no tune, but
just natural outpourings of utter blissfulness, like the songs of the birds on a
Spring morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How well I
remembered these hedgerows! Their leafy depths held all the romance of life and
nature, the canal's dark waters all the essence of mystery and distance.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The green verge, with hints of daisy, buttercup and
dandelion was a garden of fairyland, and the rich country air sang in my ears
and the sun was vital and inspiring on my head.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">Later we would come back
and search these canal banks far beyond this short half-mile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We would go back beyond the station turn to see the brick-kiln (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">3</a>), and drink
milk at the house with the Cuckoo-clock, and the family-album which played tunes
as you turned its pages: in the other direction we would pass the milk and explore the further reaches where the leaves on the bank
grew thicker, and the banks rose high with pines and wooded walks (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">4</a>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here a spring would fall tinkling into the canal; here a horse would plod
along towing a barge or so at the end of a long rope - barges gaily painted and
wafting smells of cooking into the clear air, with perhaps a merry boy or girl
on deck who would call to you a cheerful greeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here the track of the limestone quarries would come to the landing stage
and at last the dark waters would vanish into the mouth of a darker tunnel.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">But today we saw none of
these things, we turned aside again, past the canal bridge with its humble
cottages, underneath an avenue of noble oaks - long since given over to the
woodman, and sold I am sure at a handsome profit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So up the lane into the village street - so up the
sloping path to &quot;Rose Cottage&quot; (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">5</a>) to be met with a flurry of affection by
old Mrs. Greet.&nbsp; It was lovable, this quaint house, with its smell of oil-lamps
and pickles, and all the other indescribable signs of a house that has been a
home, settled and complete, beloved and lived in - a house that has been an
abiding solace, and has shared the joys and torments of those whom it protects,
and who in their turn care for it very dearly. But again I longed to be alone
for a quick glance into the parlour, and then a quiet rush upstairs to the room
which was to be mine for a season.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">Here was a large
comfortable bed, on angular crouching ceiling which shut one in tightly at night
like a Jack-in-a-box, carved pillars in a corner taken from some dismembered
four-poster, and a tiny dressing-chest - its drawers full of bed-linen wrapped
in the smell of lavender - its top crowded with small boxes, each full of
unknown treasures, photographs, and small china ornaments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two candlesticks which would later light me to a happy bed of warm and
glorious content. But now to the window, a muslin-shaded casement where one
could sit and overlook the garden, the garden-seat and the table where one would
play in the sun, and where sometimes would have tea with the table cloth playing
in the wind, and wasps trespassing in the jam and cream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I sat there, blissfully still, savouring again that quintessence of
quietude - away from the dust and noise of the city and the trials of schooldays
- alone with the English countryside and the remote sound of the doves from
their home just out of sight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
this sweet song I would awake on the morrow, and the next day, and so on along a
vista of days of enlightened enchantment.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">One such holiday stands out
very pertinently, for on this occasion I had just completed a song to the words
of Laurence Houseman. &quot;The Wood Maze&quot; it was called, and I had
wandered about with its lines humming in my head till they must perforce be put
on paper in musical idiom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
arrived at our village to find there the incarnation of the heroine of the poem
- a small girl of 12, hazel eyes, &quot;bobbing curls&quot; and that curious
rustic charm which is born to natives of rural Shropshire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To the charms of the village were added now a new enchantment, for life
had been a singularly lonely one for me, and I was at the age to seek for
companionship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was a quiet
child, shy but friendly, and soon we were inseparable - the claims of parents
and friends being met with an aching acceptance which was an exquisite pain.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#000080">Together we spent this most
idyllic month, she with her doll - Susannah Mary - and I with my music, union I
would play to her uncomprehending yet wondering ear on the timid old piano in
the parlour. Together we roamed the garden to visit the doves, or feed the pigs,
or suck delicious raspberries from the sun-warmed canes; we spent quiet moments
in the cool church, wandering among the bell-ropes of the tower, or visiting the
tomb of some local knightly warrior (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">6</a>). We clambered dustily through the mill,
going carefully among the flapping belts of the machinery, and treading warily
over the trapdoors descending at last, warm and happy to view with awe the
mighty wheel of the great engine which controlled it all (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">7</a>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We haunted the canal-side, waiting patiently to see the lime-stone wagons
loaded till their weight was enough to take them downhill to the tipping-stage
while pulling the empty ones up on the other rail-road (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">8</a>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Hide and seek and touch-and-go&quot; (here was Laurence Housman's
poem again) among the bushes, where one has to go warily on account of rabbit
holes and &quot;Sweethearts&quot; stuck to one's clothes. And so on, through
three blissful hot summer weeks, till the time came that she must go away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I saw her train leave the station and went back with a lump of lead where
my heart should be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The village was
clouded, the warmth of the sun dimmed by the mists of unhappiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wandered round alone, re-visiting places which had shared our
happiness, trying to imagine that I heard again her bubbling laughter, and saw
the light of innocence in her eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing
remained but the dark chill of blind misery - the lovely tune was dead in my
ears as I played once again its naive cadences.<o:p>

the village, revisited, has never held but sentient memories of those halcyon
hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The placid horses have gone
from the canal and sputtering motor-boats now disturb its once tranquil waters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bushes have been closed against trespassers (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">9</a>), and a new road traverses
the village (<a href="percy_whitlock.htm#ref">10</a>), whereon motor-buses swirl and stink on their way to the nearby
city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The doves are dead, and with
them the glory of this lovely piece of England is departed.<o:p>
