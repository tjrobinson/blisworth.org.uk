<p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080"><b>ALONG
THE MAIN ROAD IN THE MID 40’s<o:p>
 </b>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Coming into the
village from Northampton you passed the Digby house on the right –
pebble-dashed and white.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jack
Digby worked at the carriage works at Wolverton and probably at that time commuted
using the village railway station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the other side of the road and up the bank was a wooden building used by the
military during the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Coming
into the village proper there is George Bonsor’s <a href="../Farms.htm#gable"> high gabled
barn</a>,
subsequently converted to a house, and his farmhouse facing the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was good to the village, allowing his field to be used for football
and the school sports.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Adjoining his
farmhouse was Cherry’s dairy where one could purchase milk and at this
junction of the road stood the large <a href="../Elmtree.htm"> Elm tree</a> on a triangular patch of land to
one side of which stands the village school serving all ages of children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the time it was under the very able headmaster <a href="../Articles/Misc&#32;LogBook&#32;2.htm#cole"> Joe
Cole</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was no trucking the children around the County in those days. The
building was to double in size over the next fifty years.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Opposite the
school was the Council yard and the shed which housed a steam roller, one house
further along, on the right, was the village bakery run by the Sturgess family
using a traditional oven and still making bread by hand although they would
eventually become mechanised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like
many villagers they kept pigs in the back garden and poultry down the lane.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Moving on we would
pass the Phillips family paper <a href="../Shop.htm">shop</a>, it being still a stone thatched property
with a pump outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They ran a
similar enterprise in Milton. On the other side of the road was the all
important telephone box as ordinary folk did not yet have their own phones and
opposite was the residence of our village photographer <a href="../People-two.htm#walex"> Walter
Alexander</a>, who
subsequently made a small showcase where he illustrated his work as “The
Passing Show”.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Crossing back to
the other side of the road there was Mr. Hill’s little <a href="../Highsttwo.htm"> cobblers shop</a> which
had that lovely smell of leather and from his doorstep you viewed the Royal Oak,
a Phipps Brewery house, which was thatched and had railings at the front
protecting the windows.&nbsp; There was a large horse chestnut tree to one side, the tenant
Sam Brown had a large collection of birds eggs which he eventually gave away.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">The village <a href="../Articles/post_office_services.htm"> Post
Office</a> was opposite the pub with a bay window and a flight of steps to the door, the
mail was still sorted locally in the sheds at the rear and local postmen
delivered the mail hereabouts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Local
knowledge was important as the majority of houses had not yet been given
numbers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Behind the Post
Office and with two petrol pumps on the street was Freeston’s garage where you
could obtain paraffin (or was that Youngs?), get your accumulator charged, buy
or have a bike repaired, purchase paint and wallpaper, find a taxi and even have
your car serviced or repaired. The four brothers were a village institution and
were obviously well thought of.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Again crossing
back across the road to the two thatched cottages and forge that stood at one
side of the Cross.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The blacksmith
still plied his trade although this was probably decreasing as the war had been
instrumental in introducing the Fordson tractor some of which had wide
mudguards, which we youngsters would ride upon.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Doug was one of
the residents of the cottages on the Cross and he would get very irate when the
Americans parked their fuel tankers on the Cross and smoked in the vicinity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were obviously tanks and convoys regularly passing through the
village during and after the war, with additional journeys being made to the
tank training grounds at Showsley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Post Office <a href="../Articles/post_office_services.htm">sorting shed</a> and Young’s advertising hoarding, which advertised what
became Rootes group vehicles, were eventually demolished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This followed young Cholkers accident with a prefab-carrying articulated
lorry in a dangerously narrow part of the High Street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accident could also have been induced by the advertising hoarding,
which had reflective cats-eyes embedded in it for night-time impact.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Inside Young's shop
was a typical general store of the time, half the size of the present shop with
Oliver blending and packing the tea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bacon
was cut to the thickness required and the range of alcoholic beverages,
groceries available was substantial.&nbsp; On the walls were buckets and pans - most
types of household hardware were stocked. In later years when the cellar was
cleared they even found the old moulds used to make the boat candles.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">The adjacent
houses appear to have stopped serving teas by this time but property owning John
Foster, living in a house to the right, supplemented his income by selling fruit
and keeping a flock of hens in his paddock which eventually became part of
Westbrook and Pond Bank. Another of his enterprises was hiring out the &quot;Labour
Party tables&quot; and trestles which were stored in his old bakehouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; No charge was
made - you gave what you thought would be suitable.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Moving down four
properties brought us to Burbidge’s yard where, in the many sheds, caravans
and vehicle bodies were made, wood was sawn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Old cars were kept at the bottom of the yard - ideal for playing in.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Opposite was the <a href="../Articles/Law_and_order.htm"> Police house</a> where Fred Wooding resided,
keeping law and order in the Parish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
good policeman!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two more houses
down lived the man from the Pru, one of the early residents to have a car.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080"><a href="../Highsttwo.htm">Opposite</a> stands
the church still much the same then as it is today except we had a choir in
those days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There may be less
hostility now between the congregations of the two places of worship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alongside the church the old rectory was still in use by the vicar and
was reached by a long drive from the main road.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Off the drive to the right was the old coach house, used as a
garage and an apple store (upstairs), alongside Kendrick kept a few pigs in
later years. The coach house and a large section of retaining wall was
subsequently demolished to improve the bend at the bottom corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The graveyard was still open for burials although Eddie did at times
murmur about using the roadways for graves.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Passing from the
graveyard to another Phipps pub - The <a href="../Sunmoonstars.htm"> Sun, Moon and Stars</a> - was in the care of
Wally Rogers and Marg Collins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pub had a wide following.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marg
looked after the small garden in the corner of the yard, which was probably
church property, and the old garage was where the Wiggins coal lorry
subsequently parked. The row of cottages running down to the canal, behind the
pub, was called Phipps Cottages at the time with at least one of the residents
providing teas for the fishermen in earlier days.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">The <a href="../BlisworthMill.htm"> old mill</a> was
in use as a store and, since the bottom bus-stop was sited right on the bridge, one
could shelter under the loading bay awning in inclement weather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were still houses in the yard of Grafton House and the land at the
rear was used for storing army vehicles for a time.<o:p>
</o:p>
