and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who worked in it, Andy Newbery.</font></p>
</b>
<p><font color="#000080">It is Saturday morning and the time was then,<br>
The waking village nestles in the autumn light<br>
and a stillness broken only by the robin's song,<br>
on the corner stands a boy with grubby knees<br>
and it is I.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is Saturday morning and the time was then,<br>
and he stands at the doors of the redbrick shop,<br>
the grocers shop by the roadside - looking over to Gayton hill.<br>
He peers through the window and peeps inside,<br>
coins tinkle in his pocket.<br>
Above his head the sombre slates slant grey<br>
against the bleak October sky.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is Saturday morning and the time was then,<br>
and the boy opens the big grey doors and scurries in<br>
to the smell of hardware and paraffin, paint and bristle brushes.<br>
Tea, bacon, cheese and coffee aromas fill his nostrils,<br>
draw him in and make him feel at home.<br>
And many homes are here - all represented and shared<br>
over the counter stretching long and vast before him.<br>
For the heart of Blisworth beats here,<br>
where buckets hang from their ceiling hooks<br>
with pots, pans and cheese graters, sweets chocolates and cakes.<br>
What wonders lie among those shelves!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is Saturday morning and the time was then,<br>
and over the counter bar, besmocked and bespectacled<br>
Mr. Young bustles, assured, in happy charge,<br>
The boy watches as tins, bags and bottles pass before him,<br>
coins jingle, tills ring, people chatter and laugh.<br>
Spellbound he watches the drudgery of the day transformed before his eyes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is Saturday morning and the time was then,<br>
now the boy stands at the counter which dwarfs his tiny frame,<br>
He asks for his Mum's bread and a quarter of dividend tea,<br>
with his errand complete he disappears out through the big grey doors.<br>
In the still air his feet clipper-clap round the corner and out of sight.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It was Saturday morning and the time was then.<br>
The boy has gone but the memory lingers<br>
of feet that crossed that threshold through the big grey doors,<br>
into the place that was the home of a thousand hearts.</font></p>
