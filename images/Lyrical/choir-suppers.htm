<p>The Choir Suppers, c. 1910, as recalled for G. Freeston by Witty Whitlock, 1963.</p>
</b>
<p>Well, years ago we always looked forward to the 'kiyor' suppers. There were
ringers, singers and church wardens and also the Sunday school leaders. It was a
marvellous time - we used to have a lovely do as much as one could wish for; and
the Rector used to give it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Fred Chester (<a href="../Sunmoonstars.htm">Sun, Moon and
Stars</a>) had the order
for one year and <a href="../Earlyindust.htm#tee"> Thomas Tee</a> (Royal Oak) the other and I think they worked
hard to
see we had the very best supper.</p>

The boys had to go at nine o'clock and the men were supposed to go at ten
o'clock but as the years went on the suppers became like the times - a little
bit out of hand. After we had done supper the tables were cleared and we used to
have whisky - not the boys! - then it was a sing-song. They would call on the
choir members with [school headmaster] <a href="../schools.htm#green"> Arthur Green</a> on the piano. And he used to play well, with his
little glass to drink from when he stopped playing.&nbsp; But when he came back his
glass was empty every time. He found out who it was because after he had had <i>his</i>
drink he made to refill the glass completely. Sure enough, it would be empty
again. Later on in the evening, Arthur then started a good old song at the piano and got everyone to sing
well and stand up. It were Joe ***** who was falling about trying not to
show anything - found him out he did. Joe always wore a gert belt with a big brass buckle, by the
way. No sooner did he start to sing he said - &quot;I've forgot it&quot;.
&quot;Well, you better sit down and have another go&quot; but he soon got up
again and had another little drop of whisky.&nbsp; He was soon falling about
again and the Rector said to me &quot;Whitlock, the best thing you can do is to
get him home&quot;&nbsp; I got him outside and he said &quot;Oh, I do feel ill -
I do feel ill - I shall die&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Come on let's get you
home&quot;&nbsp; Oh dear, oh dear - after a minute he went Br...br..br and he
said &quot;that's buggered it&quot; - he messed his trousers.&nbsp; He was going
to fight me for going the wrong way but I took him home and lent him against the
door &quot;I shall be alright&quot;.&nbsp; He opened the door and went head
first in.&nbsp; The chairs and tables started flying everywhere - well, I left
him.</p>

<p>When I got back to the school room I told the Rector I had took him home - to
my great relief.</p>

<p>The suppers were hot, a leg of mutton, a lump of beef and baked puddings and
they were cooked in the bakehouse nearby [Sturgess' late of Westley's].&nbsp;
Mrs. Chester had the best suppers - she also provided a jugged hare for those
who wanted it, some had <i>all</i> the dishes!!&nbsp; Those who didn't like
jugged hare had rabbit pie.</p>

<p>The old man [Reverend] Barry went at ten o'clock.&nbsp; When Master Barry
took over it used to be until eleven o'clock before they finished the booze -
but when he was gone we got going again until twelve or one.</p>

<p>We all had a church-warden [pipe and tobacco] - even though they didn't all
smoke, but it were free.&nbsp; Later, we finished off the evening by <a href="../Articles/Whitlock-memoirs.html#handbells"> going round
with handbells</a>.&nbsp; We collected the cash to buy them - they didn't come out
of church expenses.</p>
