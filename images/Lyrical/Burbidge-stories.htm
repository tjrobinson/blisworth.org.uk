<p><b><font color="#000080" size="3">Fred Burbidge, Engineer, recalling two
stories for G. Freeston, c. 1960s</font></b></p>
<p><font SIZE="3"><font color="#000080">Fred Burbidge was born in 1884, two
years before being brought to Blisworth from Gayton. He, along with his
brothers, set up in the village a timber felling and sawing business and a
carpenters shop on an industrial scale on a site off the High Street, opposite
the church. His father had a steam-engine business which commissioned traction
engines, operated threshing machines and built special purpose engineering
equipment.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>The first story is of Henry Ploughman</b> as told to him by
the Mallard brothers, Freddie and Frank. In 1804 Henry worked on the tunnel for
the canal. Having too much to drink the night before, he felt sick one Friday
and left the work place to walk home down the toll road (Stoke Road). He met the
horse and wagon coming up the road with the pay-day cash and flagged it down to
not miss out on being paid. He and the driver passed the time of day and, when
finished, he bid the driver farewell and went home to lie down. When the wagon
arrived at the tunnellers the driver realised that the tailboard was hanging
loose. But worse - a bag containing half-sovereigns and some silver was missing.
The driver, once he realised he was in serious trouble, mentioned he had met
Henry on the way up and so a party of workers wasted no time in going down to
Henry's house to see if he had found the bag lying in the road. Henry said he
knew nothing of the bag and invited the men to search his house - they found
nothing.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A few months afterwards, Henry left the village to be
never seen again. He did the right thing by the villagers though; he cleared all
his debts in the village shops - in some cases paying them off with
half-sovereigns. Perhaps the Grand Junction Canal company later got him a free
passage to Australia!</font></p>
</font>

<p><font color="#000080"><b>[The second is from a tape transcription]</b>&nbsp; &quot;I managed the trees on the estates at Stoke Park and at
Stowe. The Master of Kinloss, at Stowe, once asked me to cut down all the trees
in the avenue but the trustees (National Trust?) heard about it and stopped us
just in time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;The Master of Kinloss had the first Morris
&quot;Oxford&quot; that was made and he bought it off Bill Morris who promised
that it would do 70 mph up the two mile long avenue. But it would only do 50 mph
and so Kinloss got in touch with Bill Morris who said he would come next Tuesday
and improve it. So Kinloss said, &quot;Burbidge, Morris is coming over and I
want you to be with me - we are going to try this motor to do 70 mph&quot;.
Morris came with his mechanic and tried jet after jet and got it to do 75 mph.
Morris said it would be better to go back one and make it just do 70
mph.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinloss then ordered seven motors for his friends and invited
Bill Morris in for a drink. When Morris said he never drank Kinloss said
&quot;well <u> Burbidge</u> <i>does</i>!&quot; and we had bread and cheese with the drink and
Morris had lemonade.&nbsp; Finally Morris said &quot;I cannot stop and I have
such a lot to do&quot; - he was a wonderful man and he turned out to be Lord
Nuffield*.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&quot;There's more to Kinloss - he was an ordained parson too
and he came to Blisworth on three occasions to preach. He said to me afterwards
&quot;What did they say about me, Burbidge?&quot; &quot;If I told you you would
never speak to me again - you'd be cross with me&quot; But he said &quot;do be
straightforward with me&quot; and I
said, &quot;they think you are a wonderful preacher who points the way but never
goes himself&quot;&nbsp; Kinloss replied &quot; They're dead right - bloody well
right!&quot; How ever he managed to preach without swearing I can't
understand.&nbsp; I spent seven years on and off with him on the estate and he
was the only gent who could . . . . [something about a napkin and a bottle of Johnny Walker
on a wall but I cannot decipher it, you try and please let me know!] . . . . I've never seen
anyone repeat [the trick] before.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">* [Morris of course founded the Morris and Nuffield
vehicle company at Cowley, Oxford.&nbsp; He was recognised for services to the Empire
for vehicles used in WW I and for the export of whole factories, eg. to Japan]</font></p>
