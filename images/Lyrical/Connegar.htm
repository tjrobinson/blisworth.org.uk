<p><font color="#000080"><b>Connegar Praise - about the wonderful place where<br>
I was born and lived for 24 years - Andy Newbery.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Connegar Leys, Connegar Leys,<br>
How I remember your Connegar ways,<br>
Council house Christmases, postmen on bikes,<br>
Sombre faced rent men and children on trikes,<br>
Girls with their skipping ropes, boys with their mates,<br>
Mothers in aprons conversing at gates,<br>
One wants some sugar, another some tea,<br>
Everything borrowed and everything free,<br>
faces and families, laughter and tears,<br>
Connegar days into Connegar years.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Midsummer mornings expectant and bright,<br>
The cosy embrace of a Connegar night,<br>
The blue sky, white clouds, warm summer rays,<br>
The sight of my house through Connegar haze,<br>
Just a few houses - you say with a smile,<br>
An ordinary street where you lived for a while,<br>
Oh no - I reply - not an ordinary place,<br>
for here was a heart, a soul and a face,<br>
Its children were happy, its homes played their part,<br>
in giving their offspring a hope and a start,<br>
My friends and my loved ones grew up here and played,<br>
and all that they did here was history being made.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So down through the years I'll continue to raise,<br>
Joyfully and thankfully Connegar Praise.</font></p>
