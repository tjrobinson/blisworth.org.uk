        2011:&nbsp;</b>at present, enough funds have been raised to finish the
        erection of the shell. Money is still to be raised to fit out the
        interior, demolish the old hut (being a condition on being able to use
        the new one) and landscape the area.&nbsp; The building shell will take
        another 3 to 4 months.&nbsp; The interior will consist of a large hall
        with full WC facilities and there will be a kitchen and store
        room.&nbsp; There will also be some upper floor storage areas.&nbsp; The
        track will be opened at some point, perhaps when car parking space has
        been laid out, which will be to the left on the site.</font>

        panel above.&nbsp; The entrance will be in the wall facing the football
        field beyond whilst there will be access for storage at the face nearest
        the camera position.&nbsp; The whole area will be fenced off for reasons of
        security, there will be no windows to defy vandalism whilst natural
        light will be via roof windows. </font>

        gained completion.&nbsp; Then, as announced in the December 2011 issue
        of &quot;Round &amp; About&quot;, &quot;w<font size="3">hat a wonderful
        night we had on 17th November when all members of the group gathered
        together and processed up to the New Community Scout Hall (this being
        the new name given to it, rather than &quot;Scout Hut&quot;). The
        District Scout band led the way and gave the occasion a real celebratory
        feeling. Our newest Beaver cut the ribbon and everyone came into the
        hall and watched as we broke the flag for the first time in the new
        hall. To see all the scouts standing in a semi-circle as we performed
        that ceremony was a truly magical moment and one that will stay with me
        always. A picture of this is hoped for.&nbsp; Then on the 26th November
        we opened our doors so the village could come and see the hall, such
        positive comments from visitors gave us a real buzz. At both events
        Greta Bodsworth came, who along with her husband had built the old hut
        way back in 1973, we may have a fantastic new hall but our history is
        still very important, it was so good to see her there. </font> <font size="3">We
        still have things to do so the hard work is not over yet, we will be
        holding our official opening on 25th February when we hope to have
        representatives of all those who have awarded us grants or given
        donations&quot;.&nbsp; These words from Sandra O'Connor, Group Scout
        Leader.</font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The pictures below include a little of the
        ceremony and views of the interior space and the kitchen
        service hatch with an access to storage and toilets.&nbsp; There is a
        charming plaque proclaiming &quot;Sandra O'Connor had a dream&quot; and
        citing her efforts in 2011 to realise that dream.&nbsp; She has done
        tremendously well.</font></p>
