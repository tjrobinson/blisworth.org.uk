        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When
        the new Scout hall was constructed some of us expressed dismay that a
        location within the council fields closer to the village could not have
        been found. However, on a pleasant day, the walk up to the far end is no
        ordeal (!) and the friendliness of the presenters and the scouting
        community made full amends. The day was a notable opportunity to blend
        the Blisworth community with that of a rather wider area - always
        welcome. The First-Blisworth scout troop serves the area essentially of
        south-Northampton and has a number of Blisworth boys as members. The Fun
        Day was an afternoon show and turned out to be a mini-fete that occupied
        the hall with various stalls and made good use of the unused end of the
        football field. There was a welly-wanging competition in progress and an
        arena for a water battle that seemed essentially just an opportunity to
        cool off.</span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Only
      one hour after the opening there were dozens of cars parked nearby and
      over 200 visitors. Apparently there were opportunities to try out ones
      scouting skills later on. Good knot-tying ability is well worth the
      training! A few of the village societies were represented as stalls for
      advertising their role or selling wares, eg. garden plants and
      stitcherydoings. By the way, scouts from the First-Blisworth have a
      woggled yellow and black triangle around their neck so you'll know who are
      ours! The preferred shirt is buff but many boys just wear anything; it
      goes, as long as the woggled-triangle is worn as well.</span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
      Grafton District Scout Band did an excellent job on the ambience with
      popular tunes being played for most of the afternoon. Of course the
      weather helped the gathered company enormously - better than was served up
      for the Jubilee mini-fete held at the football pavilion two years
      ago.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>The
      Mikron Theatre Company</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the same day this company put on
      a performance of &quot;When the Cows Come Home&quot; and that was held at
      the low level part of the Old Rectory garden (with access by gate from the
      canal towpath). It is a little tricky for some to get there and all should
      carry their own chair - okay, for those having a light-weight folding
      chair. Actually, over 150 people enjoyed a brilliant performance in the
      congenial surroundings and nobody twisted their ankle in the turf; such an
      event putting a dampener on the performance last year! There may be a move
      to get Mikron to coincide with the August Canal Festival in order to
      expand attendance. </span></font><center><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
