<font size="4">T<b>he first meeting of the new Church Council</b> was held on May 21st, there being present the Rector W. W. Colley, Messrs. H. Perkins, A. Harris, W. Collins, E. Griffith, T. Sturgess, E. Ayres, E. R. Freeston, Mrs. Sturgess, Mrs. J. Griffith, Mrs. E. T Freeston, Mrs. W. Harris, Mrs. G. Perkins, Mrs. H. Perkins, Mrs. O. Young, Mrs. A.
Robinson. Miss Sharpe, Miss Ayres, and Mrs. Meers.&nbsp; Apologies from Dr. and Mrs. Jeaffreson and Mrs. Colley. Dr. Jeaffreson was
re-elected vice-chairman, and Mr. E, E. Griffith hon. secretary. The Parochial apportionment of the Diocesan Fund amounting, as last year, to £22 13s. 10d. was accepted,
and a brief budget for the present year was put forward. The Prayer Book Measure of 1928 was discussed after a brief explanation from the Chairman, and it was decided to send a
resolution to the local Member of Parliament, asking him to support the Measure. The Chairman
mentioned that the new Prayer Book, if passed, need only be used by those parishes who wished to do so.<br>
The wonderful improvement in the appearance of the churchyard and the cemetery, thanks to the zealous efforts of a number of
volunteers, came up for the thanks and praise of the whole meeting. Mrs. J. Griffith has managed to inspire everyone with her own enthusiasm for the work, which
is, after all, one of the duties assigned to all Church Councils. We may well be proud of the work done. The Chairman appealed for more subscribers to the
Freewill Offerings. The Churchwardens largely depended on these, to balance their annual accounts. Mrs. Meers was appointed
hon. secretary. Dr. Jeaffreson being treasurer, and other members of the committee are: Mrs. Arthur Green, Mr. C R. Shakeshaft, Mrs.
W. Harris.<br>
A set of new hymn books for the church and choir have been obtained as a gift to the
church with the help of a grant from the publishers and a sum of 10s. handed in for Jumbles by Mrs. J.
Lepper.&nbsp; In the recent Church of England Temperance Society examination, eight members of the Guild of St. John
were entered. They were: George Perkins, Percy Kendall, John Marriott, Bernard Burbidge, Paul Fitzhugh, Arthur Warren, Fred
Digby and Gladys Goode.&nbsp;

Blisworth was second for the junior banner.<br>
