        When, in 2001, the contents of the late George Freeston's house were
        being organised for dispatch to the Northampton- shire Records Office, one
        of the Executor's decided to make his own minor collection of memorable
        documents and photographs.&nbsp; The dispatched material has become
        known as the <b> 2002 George Freeston Collection</b> at the NRO and has been
        thoroughly sifted for material of interest to this website.&nbsp; In the
        course of the succeeding eight years the executor has decided that his
        personal collection was not so much of interest to him and it has been
        sent back to Blisworth.&nbsp; It comprises of just one smaller box containing
        only a few documents of interest with about 200 photographs of which
        well over half are photographs we already have.&nbsp; There were many
        35mm colour negatives of negligible interest because they are not
        relevant to Blisworth history.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Over
        the next few weeks some photographs and one or two documents will be added to
        pages of this website and will be referred to as &quot;Collection
        Supplement&quot;.&nbsp; The inset photograph here shows about a third of the boxed material that was
        dispatched to the NRO in 2001.&nbsp; The 'new' material will either be
        added to the NRO material or kept by the Blisworth Heritage Society.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>
