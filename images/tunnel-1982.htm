        celebration, at both Stoke Bruerne and Blisworth, for the<br>
        25th anniversary of the re-opening of the tunnel after the repairs

        the 22nd August 2009 and a <a href="Anni-Reopen/25-anniversary.htm">page

        <p align="left"><b>19-00 </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1980s it had
        become clear that major works would be needed in the Blisworth tunnel
        because of crumbling brick work and a heave upwards of the base of the
        tunnel in some places which caused concern for heavily laden narrow
        boats. 
        <p align="left">The tunnel was cut mainly through blue clay, which has
        given little trouble.&nbsp; However, for the central third of the
        tunnel, its roof penetrated through the sandy iron-bearing strata which <a href="Tunnel1982/strata&#32;diagram.htm">
        dipped in the centre of Blisworth Hill.</a>&nbsp; The water from this
        stratum caused progressive blocking of the original header ducts
        designed to carry away the excess so that water was being forced to lie
        against the brickwork.&nbsp; This ultimately eroded the joint mortar. 
        <p align="left">Many of these pictures were taken by Robin Garrett who
        was the chief engineer for British Waterways for the repair work. </td>

        headers along which men can walk (with a stoop).&nbsp; The staining
        indicates the normal height to which rust born in rainwater could
        rise.&nbsp; Often the drainage headers are set a few feet above the roof
        of the main tunnel running across the axis of the main tunnel.&nbsp;
        Many were linked together with longitudinal headers so that a layer
        above the tunnel is drained by the complex.&nbsp; Periodically the water
        was allowed to run into the tunnel through a brick-lined culvert
        emerging at the side or in the roof.</td>

        1825, only twenty years into the life of the tunnel, the Georgian
        engineers had noted gross movement as the clay all around the brickwork
        displayed considerable plasticity.&nbsp; Fortunately there were only
        isolated cases of this problem.
        <p>The initial task of the contractors was to survey all aspects of the
        tunnel, in particular a geological survey to establish the capabilities
        of the material around the tunnel.</p>

        shafts had been capped off in brick.&nbsp; It was necessary to establish
        by GPS exactly where these were situated so that allowance could be made
        for their jointing with the main tunnel.&nbsp; This one is in the middle
        of one of Don Taylor's fields near the highest point of the hill - the
        shaft would be around 35 metres tall. </td>
