        Blisworth field.</b></p>
        <p>8th June 1917    Blisworth<br>
        2/Lt. <b> Lucien Herbert Higgs</b>   25 years.<br>
        No. 5 Training Squadron, Castle Bromwich, Warks (sic).<br>
        Maurice Farman S.11 Shorthorn A6897.<br>
        <br>
        Crashed attempting to land in a field near Blisworth.  Based at Castle Bromwich and had only 3 hours
        15 minutes dual flying.  Higgs was on his first solo and must have been lost because he had only 15 minutes petrol left and was 50 miles from base.  Mr. Edwin T.
        Freeston saw the plane glide in to land in a field of clover, but it stopped suddenly and turned over and was wrecked.  Higgs received a fractured skull.  He was taken a quarter of a mile to the railway station and by train to Northampton General Hospital, where he died on 9th June 1917.&nbsp;
        His instructor thought that he landed downhill and with a following wind.</td>

        Gibson above.</b></p>
        <p>This was seen by a six year old Derek Cherry with his father one
        evening over Tiffield, quite low, heading for Roade but loosing height
        and in flames. It landed/crashed near the quarry behind Stoneworks Farm.
        There were seven aboard, no-one killed but two with severe injuries.
        They were gathered up efficiently by the military who later sent some
        lorries, which had to be towed up the field by Cherry's tractor, so that
        all the bits of the Blenheim could be taken away.</td>

        20 horses for the gun carriages and about 30 men. The men slept in the
        top barn of Cherry's farm. They were on maneuvres for some months but,
        as with many other reports of Canadians at Blisworth, the time during
        the war is forgotten.&nbsp; The tanks often let stock out of fields by
        crashing through hedges.&nbsp; There was one tragic incident where a
        tank left the road near Gayton by driving through a hedge but failed to notice that the field
        was 15 feet lower due to ironstone mining.&nbsp; The tank rolled over
        and the crew were killed.</td>

        <p align="center"><b>Cash Fund for Soldiers at the Royal Oak&nbsp;</b>
        <p>During WWII there were money collections
        organised at the Royal Oak Inn for soldiers abroad.&nbsp; Postal orders
        were written and sent out.&nbsp; One recipient who is known was Fred
        Payler (Jim Payler's father) who was attached to units in North
        Africa.&nbsp; He wrote a diary and the following emtries have been
        found:</p>
        <p><b>26/2/41</b>&nbsp; Received a 6/- Postal Order which had been sent
        on the 6th January.&nbsp; Went into Cairo and bought a fountain pen. [it
        appears he was a great letter writer!]</p>
        <p><b>10/3/42</b>&nbsp; Received 14/-, no further details.&nbsp; He was
        near Tobruk and Sidi Rizah at the time.</p>
        <p>It seems strange that a UK sterling postal order can be negotiable in
        Eygpt during the war.&nbsp; Charles Holding, who was a commandos frogman
        operating in the far east had never received any money from UK during
        the war and is unaware of the Royal Oak activity.&nbsp; Can anyone shed
        light on this mystery?</p>
        <p>For relief, Fred Payler records that he swam in the sea whenever
        possible. Dust storms, wet weather<br>
        and cold nights were a problem - presumably it was &quot;winter&quot;.</p>
