        <p align="left"><b> 06-01&nbsp;</b> Blisworth Corn Mill was built in
        1879 by Joseph Westley (jnr.) after the <a href="Earlyindust.htm#bakeh"> old mill
        and bakehouse (<b>11-03</b>)</a> in the Stoke Road was
        damaged by fire.&nbsp; It was sold in 1920 so that the
        Westleys could concentrate on a larger scale at mills on the River Nene.&nbsp;
        The Northampton Co-op bought the mill at the time of the Grafton Estate
        sale and, with the purchases of farms, attempted vertical integration of
        their business from grower to consumer.&nbsp; The project failed and the
        Grand Union Canal Company bought the mill in about 1930 to use as a
        warehouse and generated much unemployment in the village at a bad time.&nbsp; They pulled down the chimney in c. 1934.&nbsp; During
        WWII the warehouse was used to store hundreds of tons of tinned food
        rations.&nbsp; Later owners used the warehouse as a bonded store and as
        a dry foods processing factory - The Pepper &amp; Spice Company -
        until in 2000 it was converted to residential accommodation as 21 flats.</p>

        the bridge!).&nbsp; The age of the boat suggests in any case a
        considerable age for the photograph.
        <p>The bridge appears to be a
        single arch with no widening evident on the far side.&nbsp; This because
        of the choice of viewpoint - the rectangular profile of the bridge
        extension is just out of sight.

        some updates:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        During WWII the mill was used to store hundreds of tons of canned food -
        a ‘buffer store’ that was established to offset England becoming
        starved if the U-boats got too much of an upper hand.&nbsp; As the
        merchant ships were plying the Atlantic and docking in Liverpool or
        Glasgow the contents were dispersed by road and canal to various sites.
        A manager responsible for food movements, was <a href="Articles/Arm&#32;John&#32;Dale.htm"> hired by the UK government
        and lived at Blisworth Arm - his son John Dale has written to us</a>.&nbsp;
        Some paper work, discovered by George Freeston, is generally headed up with a title such as “S S Empire
        Lea - 560 packs of pilchards” for incoming batches and, in some cases,
        a wonderfully entitled subject for outgoing - “Salmon for London”.
        There were many letters exchanged about the fact that the number of
        packs received was at variance with the number sent. The “Salmon for
        London” correspondence rumbled on for weeks until someone admitted
        that the number of damaged packs had been grossly exaggerated and,
        indeed, there were some ‘inexplicable’ losses after all!</font>
        <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;There is a story about the mill in the
        war years which George used to relate, “as a group of school
        boys from Tiffield were walking through Blisworth they leant over the
        bridge parapet and observed many packs of food through the windows. As
        the weather was particularly cold at the time they walked over the canal
        which would normally have ensured security and broke in. They filled
        their pockets with cans and made their way home. They overdid things
        because days later, when the thaw came, there was exposed, yard by yard
        from under the snow drifts, a bonus for the villagers in those rationed
        times - and then another and another . . . &quot;</font></td>
