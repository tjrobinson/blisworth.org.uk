        On clear days with low traffic, the other end can be easily seen from
        the towpath at the Blisworth end.&nbsp; This is best in winter.&nbsp;
        Use of binoculars is advisable.&nbsp; <b>In this photo I have enlarged
        the sight of the far end by 10 times</b> to give an impression of a
        tunnel only 305 yards long.
        <p>The tunnel actually &quot;wriggles&quot; by over 1 metre in and out
        and something similar happens to the roof.&nbsp; The far end can be seen
        only over a rather narrow range of positions.&nbsp; Start by standing,
        with both feet on the brick wharf, near to the edge and work backwards,
        away from the tunnel mouth, until you get to the end of the wharf. Now,
        if you move, you can see the view being cut off because of the
        non-straight sides.&nbsp; Hang on to kids doing this!!<br>
