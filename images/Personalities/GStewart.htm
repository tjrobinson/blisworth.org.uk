        recorded as Joseph Stewart, Mill Wharf. In 1952, at the time of general
        house numbering there was a widow recorded at No.4, The Mill - Joseph
        having passed away in 1944. At least
        this confirms the family, at one time a Joseph and F.&nbsp; Stewart,
        parents who have a grandson still living in the village (Doug Stewart).</font>

        the late Jim Payler looked for a photograph of Granny Stewart's house
        which was located on the opposite side of the canal from where, as a
        boy, he grew up with his parents - in number 72 High Street, set behind
        the Sun, Moon and Stars public house.&nbsp; This family house is shaded
        pink in the map part of the inset image.</font></span></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">It
        seemed that while various experienced photographers, such as Walter
        Alexander, were shooting at 'everything' on the canal and villagers were
        recording at random, sometimes from the top of the church tower, there
        was never the right angle to pick up Granny Stewart's house. Apparently
        she was quite a character who made an impression on Jim.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Somebody,
        in the early 1950s, before the mill bridge was widened, took a fair
        picture looking through the rounded arch of the large Victorian
        hump-backed bridge hidden within mill bridge.&nbsp; There is modest hut
        in the distance, set nearer to the camera than the sewage management hut
        that one can just make out through the arch. A visit down to the canal
        bank with a camera confirms the alignment and the deductible position of
        the modest hut, which is now gone, that must have been just at the boundary of
        the wharf-company's land. Currently there are too many boats moo
