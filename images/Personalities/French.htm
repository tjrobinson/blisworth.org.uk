        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Ron
        French was born May 2nd 1921 in <a href="../Stokerd01.htm#french"> a house on Stoke
        Road</a>, Blisworth and
        grew up with brother Arthur and sister Wyn.&nbsp; All went to the County
        School in Blisworth.&nbsp; At the age of sixteen, having left school and
        starting work as a bottler at Phipps Brewery in Northampton, he
        joined the Blisworth Oddfellows.&nbsp; In addition to building a Phipps
        pension he also began saving money at
        sixpence (old-pence) each four weeks with the Oddfellows Society for a considerable time.&nbsp;
        Although <a href="../Sun-Moon&#32;and&#32;Stars/Records/OF-Records.htm">the
        Oddfellows</a> became unfashionable after WWII, Ron is believed to have
        stayed with them until they closed in Blisworth in the 1970s.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">He
        joined the Grenadier Guards in March 1941 and served as part of the defense
        force in England until June 1944.&nbsp; One suspects the work at the
        home base was a bit boring, judging from a photo Ron sent back to the
        family.&nbsp; He was then posted
        within an armoured battalion of the Grenadier Guards into a danger zone;
        to serve in North
        West Europe, seeing the end of hostilities and presumably serving in
        Germany as the occupying force.&nbsp; He was demobbed in November 1946
        with an exemplary record and received the Star France &amp; Germany, the
        Defense Medal and the War Medal.&nbsp; He then signed up for the
        &quot;reserves&quot; as Lance Corporal - Guardsman.</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">At the age of 24
        he married Elsie.&nbsp; She wore a beautiful white
        wedding dress and Ron donned his Guards ceremonial uniform.&nbsp; He
        remained with Phipps until it closed and then continued with
        Carlsberg.&nbsp; He thus worked at the same industrial site for his entire working life
        and as a result this notable performance appeared &quot;in the headlines&quot; when he eventually
        retired.&nbsp; At weekends he <a href="../people-three.htm#french"> worked as a chimney
        sweep</a>, often turning up for
        the traditional 'good luck' at some
        village weddings.&nbsp; Like the Freeston sons, though younger than
        them, he was very keen on motorcycles, swapping from one 'pride and joy'
        to another every few years.</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Living with Elsie, at first in Stoke
        Road and later at number 15 Connegar Leys, they raised five children; Tony, Linda,
        Geoff, Christine and Paula. It was Linda (now Linda Burrows) who has
        provided most of the information for this short article.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">As
        a keen allotment grower he was well known for creating, each Autumn, the neatest
        hand-dug 4 poles right through the 1960s, 70s and 80s.&nbsp; In the
        1960s, with Ron
        Law, he represented a newly formed allotments association in Blisworth in
        <a href="../Articles/Allotment-politics.htm"> a fight to
        preserve the Stoke Road allotments</a> against RTB's (forerunner to British
        Steel) keenness to sell the land for housing development.&nbsp; They were
        successful but nevertheless the village lost some allotment land to the
        development of <a href="../greenside.htm">Greenside</a>.&nbsp; He willingly offered
        his good humour, wit and valued advice to any other allotment
        holders.&nbsp; Rather late in life he conducted a walk-around the
        village with a younger relative holding a camcorder.&nbsp; From a start near the house he lived in,
        in Connegar Leys, he wandered into the centre of the village and down to
        the canal giving a running commentary as he walked about ironstone
        mining and the old manager there, some old houses, the Oddfellows and the things children did by the
        canal, which was mostly bathing and skating.&nbsp; He was
        interrupted in his rounds by just one person, whom we know to be usually vigilant, who came
        out and asked if they were spying for an estate agent, or some words on
        these lines as it was around the time the 'kitchen garden' was being
        developed.&nbsp; That person was George Freeston!&nbsp; The
        cam-recording CD has been lodged with the Blisworth Heritage Society.</span></font></p>

        image is from the motor cycle insurance schedule for the 1950s through to
        1968.&nbsp; Believe
        it or not, the item being insured was simply typed in to the
        document which thus became something the owner would not want to
        loose.&nbsp; He graduated from a 98cc Rudge to a 650cc Triumph T-bird in
        this time.

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>By way of a footnote</b>, the
        faith in an investment before WWII was solid.&nbsp; The certificate
        from the Oddfellows for Ron's saving of 6d each month carries an
        actuarial table running to 65 years (ie. till 2002) to show the capital
        to be accrued at a steady 3.5% compound interest.&nbsp; How things about
        banks have changed!</font><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
