        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">This charming little chicken shed,
        shown below, is
        tucked behind the Grafton Villas beside the railway embankment.&nbsp; It
        has not been used for housing chickens very much since about 1930.&nbsp; It
        is plywood lined and has the carcass of a folding narrow bed, sans
        mattress.&nbsp; It measures about 3 metres by 2 metres.&nbsp; The story
        of this shed was retold in the Spring of 2006 by Dr Bull.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080">Dr Jeaffreson, at his
        GP practice located at Grafton Villa, once used a brick outhouse to
        accommodate a
        waiting room, a consulting area and a small dispensary.&nbsp; At some
        point he evicted his chickens and converted this shed into a consulting
        room for reasons not disclosed.&nbsp; He installed an iron bedstead for
        patient examination.&nbsp; The austere waiting room remained in the brick outhouse
        along with the dispensary.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000080"><img height="319" src="surgery-hours.jpg" width="425" align="left">
        The practice later transferred to
        <a href="../people-three.htm#clements"> Dr W A
        Clements</a> through the war years and thence to his son, who was always
        known as &quot;Dr Steven&quot;, and eventually to
        Dr Derek Bull in 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; All these doctors used the tin consulting
        room which was, in fact, thought to be relatively comfortable compared
        to the waiting room. &nbsp;It is a wonder that few people complained
        about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, this shack
        was a full quarter of a mile outside the village.</font></p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-bottom: 20"><font size="3" color="#000080">Doctor Bull
        however thought the facility and its location were pretty poor, even with the iron
        bedstead being replaced at some stage by a folding wooden contraption
        (see below).&nbsp; By 1964 had built a
        house in Little Lane with a consulting room and waiting room semi
        detached to it. Dr Clements junior, by then, had transferred his
        practice to Roade and the illustrated card shows that the parishes did
        not demand much in the way of 'surgery hours'.&nbsp; The custom in those
        days, of course, was for the doctors to make house calls.&nbsp; Indeed,
        conditions for patients could be dire.&nbsp; There is reported the death
        of an unknown man in the Northampton &quot;Mercury&quot;:&nbsp; A man
        was declared dead at Blisworth Station on the 12 September 1879.&nbsp;
        People who knew him said he came from Roade and was known as
        &quot;Darkie&quot;.&nbsp; He was poorly dressed and was unwashed.&nbsp;
        He was seen in Station Road outside Dr Knott's house (since 1841, a <a href="../References/Doctors-villa-sm.jpg">series
        of doctors</a> have used the same house!) lying by the roadside.&nbsp;
        He said he was thinking of going to find his family in Liverpool so a
        passerby helped him to the station, sat him by the office door but
        noticed to his dismay that he had fallen over within five minutes.&nbsp;
        After he died it was established he had no money.&nbsp; Looking back
        over the intervening near 13 decades it seems obvious that either Dr.
        Knott had seen him, saw him as hopeless and penniless and suggested he
        gets to his family or, simply, the poor man desperately walked from
        Roade and called, too late in his illness, on a doctor who was out on
        his rounds.</font>
        <p align="left" style="padding-bottom: 20"><font size="3" color="#000080">When
        Dr Bull moved the shed was left where it was, disused for 50 years,
        more or less in the state it was when the last patient left.&nbsp;
        Because of its history, the shed might one day be a feature of a much
        wanted Heritage Museum in the village.&nbsp; In November 2008 an
        application was made for the shed to be demolished and this reactivated
        people in the Blisworth Heritage Society to try and save the consulting
        room.</font></td>
