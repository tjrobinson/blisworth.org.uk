        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the

        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the

        crossed the Gayton Road a few yards above a cottage called &quot;The
        Bays&quot; and ended over the canal opposite Pond Bank (house No. 44

        Ironstone was
        dropped down the chute into wooden crates in the narrow boats.&nbsp; The
        crates were then lifted by crane, at a railway siding one mile away,
        onto wagons destined for the Hunsbury iron furnaces.&nbsp; Date c. 1900
        - 1914 - the furnaces closed in 1920 and WWI interrupted production.</p>

        <p><b>18-10 </b>Date is believed
        to be 1895 according to G. Freeston (1953 &quot;Scrapbook&quot;).&nbsp;
        The difference in levels between the two sides of the picture and the
        depth of the cut indicate the thickness of the &quot;seam&quot; of
        ironstone.&nbsp; Note the curved line of planks to the right.</p>
        <p>George states the location is the field north of the Courteenhall
        Road and the vantage point is by the side of the road, over the bridge
        through which the rails ran.&nbsp; This picture therefore relates to
        picture 18-04 above.</p>
        <p>Scaled from the known width of those
        planks, 12 in, the depth of the excavation must be at least 20 feet
        where the wagons are located.&nbsp; For the location suggested by George
        that seems implausible until one notices that the houses built at the
        end of Wellspring are indeed placed very low in relation to the
        Courteenhall Road.&nbsp; Go there and wonder at the massive change that
        mining brought!</p>

        other side where it is piled at a safe stable angle.&nbsp; The modern
        way of doing the transfer is with a mechanical digger mounted on a
        turntable.&nbsp; In the Victorian open mines, all the material was
        barrowed across narrow planks.&nbsp; After some time, the central
        railway will be moved, in this scene - moved to the right, so that
        mining can continue.
