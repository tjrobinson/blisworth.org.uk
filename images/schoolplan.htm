        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">As is still perfectly
        discernable, the entrance on the left of this plan (for girls and
        infants) faces the main road and still carries over the portal the label
        &quot;Girls and Infants&quot;.&nbsp; The other entrance now yields to a
        large square assembly hall that was built in the 1950s.&nbsp; The five
        classrooms are hardly modified and are still in use.&nbsp; There is one
        tiny teacher's room on the ground floor, probably for the headmaster.&nbsp; Note how heating and
        ventilation design was arranged at the turn of the 20 century; there is
        a low level fresh air vent associated with each radiator so that when
        the radiators are warm they cause fresh air to be drawn in for
        heating.&nbsp; Five classrooms does not seem enough.&nbsp; Children at 4
        or less were the &quot;babes&quot; and infants were under seven years
        old.&nbsp; At the time, school children left school typically at 14
        having spent about two years or so with each class.</font>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">What a revelation
      this plan is!&nbsp; &quot;Offices&quot; are dry earth outside latrines and
      there is a group for boys and for girls.&nbsp; They are raised from the
      ground so that the &quot;night collection cart&quot; has access to
      clearing out.&nbsp; A quite large area is described as a drying floor and,
      at present, this is thought to be provided for drying out produce from the
      garden, especially onions and root vegetables etc. The latrines were
      probably connected to the sewers in 1928 and were provided with running
      cold water for flushing (instead of bucketed water) in the 1950s.<br>
      A boiler and coke store was housed in a basement near to the girls
      entrance - the basement is still in use.&nbsp; The roof space was only
      partially set out, wastefully, with another room for teachers that
      included a bucket flushed lavatory at the outset.&nbsp; Access to it was
      from the girls cloak room.&nbsp; That stairs access is still in use but
      the under roof accommodation has been extended.&nbsp; The record shows
      that the heating was never really adequate in winter as children kept
      their coats on throughout on some days.</font>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">The final picture
      is an aerial picture of the school with what appears to be a fine
      skittering of snow.&nbsp; When the school was first
      occupied in 1913, the summer brought news of various flying exploits,
      namely; the first voyages of the precursor to the RAF and the over flights
      of some explorers.&nbsp; Children would take the day off to try and follow
      what was going on - see <a href="Articles/Great_war.htm"> school records</a>.&nbsp; The date of this picture
      must be well after 1913 however.&nbsp; Judging from the absence of the new
      council houses on the Courteenhall Road (1935) the picture is thought to
      have been taken circa 1930.&nbsp; A neat pavement suggests a late date as
      does the presence of a few large telegraph/electricity poles.&nbsp; Across
      the top of the picture, left to right, is a triangular small orchard
      managed by the older children, a shed and the latrines and a long strip of
      gardens for growing vegetables managed by the older boys.&nbsp; The
      headmaster was forced to dig it up in the 1950s to give more space when
      the school was converted to a County Council Primary School and older
      children were not available to maintain the gardens.&nbsp; The orchard was
      retained and became an animal sanctuary in the 1960s.&nbsp; Of course,
      these days, we know the school as having received perhaps as many as four
      building additions to cope with the increased sophistication of modern
      teaching combined with greater numbers of children.</font>
