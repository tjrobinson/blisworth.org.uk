        <p>The area was sealed off, so no-one saw the
        use of earth moving machines as the canal- side was restored.&nbsp; This
        picture shows that the steepness of the land immediately adjacent to the
        towpath was increased considerably from its original 20 degrees.&nbsp;
        Later, BW covered much of this raw profile with a layer of subsoil blue
        clay.&nbsp; For what reason no one has <i>any idea</i> but its effect
        has been drastic in terms of achieving an overly sterile 'topsoil'.</p>

        dead straight and much credit must go to the Georgian engineers.&nbsp;
        On clear days with low traffic, the other end can be easily seen from
        the towpath at the Blisworth end.&nbsp; This is best in winter.&nbsp;
        Use of binoculars is advisable.&nbsp; <b>In this photo I have enlarged
        the sight of the far end by 10 times</b> to give an impression of a
        tunnel only 305 yards long.
        <p>The tunnel wall actually &quot;wriggles&quot; by over 1 metre both in and out
        and something similar happens to the roof.&nbsp; Consequently the far end can be seen
        only over a rather narrow range of positions.&nbsp; To find the right
        viewing spot, start by standing on the brick wharf near to the water's edge and work backwards,
        away from the tunnel mouth, until you get to the end of the brick wharf.
        Now you are in the ideal position.&nbsp; If you move about a little you can see the view being cut off because of the
        non-straight sides.&nbsp; Hang on to any kids trying this!!<br>
