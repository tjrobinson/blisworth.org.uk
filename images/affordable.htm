        was worked out for building what have generally been termed 'affordable
        houses', for the benefit of Blisworth people.&nbsp; It is permitted to
        consider land outside the village confines boundary for affordable
        housing and so this field near the parish fields was selected.

        structured correctly and are the houses envisaged going to be
        affordable?&nbsp; These are controversial points but the <a href="Affordable/affordable-Oct2006.htm">published
        intent and the rules</a>, not available generally until October 2006,
        seems worthy enough.&nbsp; The field selected is

        work which will provide a steel-reinforced concrete beam is then placed

        at corners.&nbsp; Little pieces of rock keep the steel away from the
        sides and base of the trenches so that the liquid concrete will
        thoroughly encapsulate the steel and prevent the steel from corroding.
        <p>A key point is that at such places as this junction, there is a
        rubble-filled column extending downwards into high strength soil.&nbsp;
        These reinforced beams are resting on the rubble columns and will not be
        exerting pressure on the clay base.&nbsp; What a contrast against the

        expansion!</p>
