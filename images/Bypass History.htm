        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;

        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the

        drawn in pencil, an intended bypass around the village beginning at the
        Sun, Moon &amp; Stars.&nbsp; On a pocket
        map c. 1825, presumably carried by the Duke's agent, there is detail
        added near the

        known why the road was never built especially in view of the substantial
        road traffic which the coming of the canal (not shown in the map) would have
        created.&nbsp; However, it seems likely the village traders would have
        made their objections. </td>

        The red line placed on this relatively recent map is very
        approximate.&nbsp; However, people seeking a house in the village c.
        1970 were told by their solicitors of the bypass plan, specifically that
        it would pass near to the bottom of the gardens of houses on the Towcester
        Road and would pass exactly over Candle Bridge (ie. replace it).&nbsp;
        The map which showed this latter intention has been lost but the
        transport department of the day (1978) confirmed that the plan had been abandoned.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blisworth Parish council minutes of 1951 note that
        the bypass would cut through a parish field adjacent to the Towcester
        Road - just off the left-hand edge of the map.</p>

        Bypass&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>(This page will be corrected if evidence is

        <p>Readers are referred to another page for a brief <a href="bypass_planning.htm">account
        of planning issues</a> bearing on this bypass.</p>
        <p><a name=lastmap></a>By 1990 the traffic through the village was up to a staggering 12000
        vehicles a day.&nbsp; In addition, the traffic through Flore was
        substantial because of the need to link to the M1 motorway the A43 trunk road
        (which is part of a major scheme joining Winchester, Hants and Market
        Deeping, Lincs.).&nbsp; The green line
        shows the new alignment of the A43 which intersects the M1 near the
        Rothersthorpe service station.&nbsp; As explained at a village
        presentation, the line minimizes intersection of farms, is close to
        parish boundaries and would use the already compacted line of the
        railway branch from Blisworth station to Northampton.</p>
        <p>Links are available at the top of this page to the works for bridges under the Gayton Road and over Station Road, the railway and the
        canal.&nbsp; On completion of the bypass, the road through the village
        was officially &quot;detrunked&quot; and some traffic calming measures
        were introduced - there is a link also to the traffic calming carried
        out in 1994.</p>

        <p>Note that Station Road was rebuilt as near as possible to the railway
        so that one system of spans could cross both.&nbsp; This left a short
        section of Station Road as a cul-de-sac and allowed a longer section, also made a
        cul-de-sac and shown dotted in the map, to be adsorbed into the
        Blisworth Park homes area.

        calming</a> measures were put in place in 1993 - the average daily number was
        around 6400 with the proportion of heavy goods vehicles unchanged.&nbsp; A <i>generous</i> estimate for the politician would
        be 5000/day in 1991, ie. around 65% of traffic used the bypass.&nbsp; The situation at off-peak
        times in the village seemed, however,
        markedly better than this statistic would suggest.</span></p>
