        link Blisworth with Stoke Bruerne, following as closely as possible the
        tunnel, starting at the north tunnel mouth and ending at the south
        tunnel mouth.&nbsp; The numbers to the paragraphs below are links to pointers on the
        map at the bottom of the page.&nbsp; It is hoped that this route will be
        more clearly marked using rambler's signs and enhanced with one or two interpretation boards once some
        funding is in place.&nbsp; The <a href="http://blisworthcanalpartnership.org/"> Blisworth Canal
        Partnership</a> in conjunction with the canal partnership at Stoke Bruerne
        have plans to raise the funds.</font></p>

        </span>Before the advent of the Grand
        Junction Canal, with its tunnel through Blisworth Hill, there was no
        cart track or road that directly connected Blisworth with Stoke Bruerne.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the space occupied by the deep excavation for the
        beginning of the tunnel, at the Blisworth end, there was <a href="../BBook/cfold.htm"> a village Green</a>
        along the western edge of which passed a brook that rose on the hill and
        flowed out under an early bridge for the Blisworth to Towcester road.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The brook continued on to a water mill some quarter-mile
        further north.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through the
        centre of The Green ran a track that passed close to a much-extended
        Nun’s Wood and led to Shutlanger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Another track, branching at The Green, led to Roade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>These tracks passed through scrub or gorse fields or orderly
        forest rather than the present day ultra-smooth modern fields.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The modern Stoke Road originated as a cart track toll-way created
        in around 1795 to cope with canal traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        The toll gate and &quot;gage&quot; for weight was located just south of
        the Knock Lane junction.&nbsp; </span>As the tunnel was being started, there was much traffic from the
        northern canal terminal in Blisworth to join the turnpike that led to
        Cosgrove where the southern canal terminal was briefly located.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>With the tunnel completed in 1805, the Stoke Road then became the
        route via which all the boat-horses were led in order to meet up with
        their corresponding barges after passing through the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is no towpath in the tunnel so barges* were
        &quot;legged&quot; through <a href="../Walks-Legging.htm"> by walking against the tunnel
        sides</a>.&nbsp; Now that the Stoke Road
        carries so much traffic, </font>t<font color="#000080">he over-hill walk, traced as a blue
        ribbon in the map, between Blisworth and Stoke
        Bruerne has become the
        preferred route for ramblers and for
        what few boat-horse teams remain.&nbsp; The route is based on the 1950s registered
        paths.</o:p>

        </span>This is <b>“The Start”</b>, especially for anyone arriving by
        car.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Driving out of Blisworth, look out for a prominent stone
        house on the left and turn right just past it where there is a tall
        black signpost to a car-park and the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Note that the stone house proclaims “<a href="../Early&#32;Industry/lime-railway.htm">Blisworth Stone Works</a>”,
        being originally an office building with living quarters established
        around 1820 and disused by 1920.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><font size="4"><a href="Tour.htm#topmap">2.</a></font></b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The steep path is the first leg of the journey from the tunnel
        mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It used to be lined
        on both sides with a sturdy timber rail that would have prevented boat
        horses from straying into the wooded slopes, barking the trees and
        conducting a hopeful search for any narcotic plant species that Blisworth has on
        occasions been noted for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
        the top there was a small stable building – a cold harbour shelter.&nbsp;
        An old field name across the Stoke Road from this shelter is &quot;Boat
        Stable Close&quot;.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><font size="4"><a href="Tour.htm#topmap">3.</a></font></b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The next leg of the journey crosses over the tunnel and leads
        into a large field.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
        interesting to note that this path was once used by a railway for horse
        drawn wagons carrying limestone down to an off-side wharf on the canal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The red line on the map shows the approximate line of the railway
        that descended from a quarry behind the stone-works building.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The path continues in a straight line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A turn right at the end takes the walker along another path that
        follows the canal, on its off-side, back to Blisworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Instead, a turn to the left <u>through the metal gate</u> sets the walker in the
        general direction of Stoke Bruerne!&nbsp; A left
        turn in the furthermost field is not permitted!</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><font size="4"><a href="Tour.htm#topmap">4.</a></font></b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>This field is called Fisher Close.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is a broad hump of spoil from digging a shaft immediately
        to the left after walking a few yards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In 1976 the shaft suddenly <a href="../Tunnel&#32;Story/photographs.htm#Dcollapse"> swallowed the electric service pole</a>
        thus demonstrating that Blisworth has its mysteries; the shaft is many
        yards to the west of the tunnel.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Before the field became known as a “close”, its
        extent was dominated by a “fish weir” ie. a manorial fish-pool.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The field was considerably more hollowed out than it appears
        now and the
        walker can see the low level that once applied, where a stream runs into
        a culvert that is boxed in by a fence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        This view of the stream can be seen just before</span> the
        path runs between the field fence on the right and some dense thorn
        bushes.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> See
        <a href="../Development/SouthVillage.jpg">this 1727 map</a> for a
        suggestion on the original course of the stream (then known as the
        &quot;Gully&quot;).&nbsp; In
        February 2009, the culvert became blocked with the resulting
        photo-opportunity recorded above.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To
        the left of that stream there was raised an earthen causeway extending
        diagonally across the field and the line of the causeway can just be
        discerned.</font><font color="#000080"> By the time of the canal, the
        field had been drained and had been tenanted by farmers for at least 60
        years.&nbsp; The causeway across the &quot;hollow&quot; was created in 1800 and was in use for 5
        years until the tunnel was finished.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">The
        causeway</span> carried <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/HillRailway.htm"> Northamptonshire’s first railway</a> that was built
        using one yard long cast-iron “plates” pegged onto stone sleeper
        blocks.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact there were twin railway lines to cope with meeting
        traffic involved in running the Grand Junction Canal between the
        terminal in Blisworth (near a large mill building) and a terminal just
        beyond Stoke Bruerne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        tunnel had taken far longer to complete than expected and engineers
        decided that the toll-way and a section that passed through the village,
        could not support the traffic - it was probably disintegrating into deep
        ruts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently
        an over-hill railway was constructed by an outside contractor; Benjamin
        Outram from Derbyshire.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Modern railway experts prefer to call the railway a “plateway”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Wagon wheels were retained on flat iron bearers, ie.
        “plates”, by high flanges cast with the plates whereas modern
        construction invariably employs flanges on the wheels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The wagons were pulled over the hill by teams of horses.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The event that has made the earthen causeway harder to
        discern was that, in 1982-3, the left hand part of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“fish weir hollow” was filled-in with bricks and rubbish
        extracted during the 1982 – 1984 <a href="../tunnel-1982.htm"> major tunnel
        repairs</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>That “filling” has now sunk down a little.&nbsp; On this walk
        there will
        be no other visible sign of the over-hill railway, which follows fairly
        closely the Stoke Road, until very near Stoke Bruerne.<a name="fisher"></a></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><font size="4"><a href="Tour.htm#topmap">5.</a></font></b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>On emerging from behind the bushes, the stream can be seen
        flowing towards the culvert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        waters reappear near the tunnel mouth as they descend a sloped waterway
        known as “The Slit”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        was the stream that filled the fish-pool.&nbsp; In the 1600s, it was called <a href="../Fisher/Fishweir.htm">
        Young’s Pool</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The stream
        has carried a few names; in 1700s it was called “South Gutter or Gully”, in
        1800s called “Winter Brook”, meaning the miller could use the stream
        only in winter, and in more recent times Wash Brook and
        Fisher Brook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The volume of
        water is very varied and there is no doubt that the engineers building
        the canal were forced to <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#divert"> carefully channel</a> the stream out of their way.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><font size="4"><a href="Tour.htm#topmap">6.</a></font></b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The path leads to a gate that has swung on its hinges over a large puddle for
        the last 30 years, a feature we hope will be remedied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once
        through the gate one can perceive a line to the left and hedge extending
        up to the Stoke Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        fact this line coincides with Knock Lane (a road branching from the
        Stoke Road in the direction of Roade) and on 1700s maps the forerunner
        to Knock Lane ran across the path and is assumed to have once connected
        up with local pathways to the west running towards Pattishall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is evidence that the track was once a trading route known
        as “<a href="../Articles/Roman-Salt-Way.html">The Saltway</a>” and was likely established in Roman times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Saltway is shown by a dashed red line on the map.&nbsp; Local
        goods moved on the Saltway probably included limestone and timber.&nbsp;
        The name &quot;knock&quot; for the road comes from <i>atten oke</i>
        meaning &quot;at the oak-tree&quot;.&nbsp; The derivation extends to <i>notch</i>,
        a sturdy bifurcated oak of cultivated form which, when felled and inverted, yields
        an <b>&quot;A&quot;</b> for the gable end of
        an elementary hovel.&nbsp; Thus we are reminded that Blisworth was quite
        close to being a forest-village in the dark ages and Norman period.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b><font size="4"><a href="Tour.htm#topmap">7.</a></font></b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Against the sky near the Stoke Road, can be seen the
        first ventilation airshaft chimney for the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There are seven ventilator shafts but trees obscure most of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The tunnel was built originally with only one or two but soon
        after a fatal accident due to smoke inhalation after a collision in 1861
        the canal company opened some of the original work shafts to improve
        matters.&nbsp; The unforeseen was that, with the start of the use of
        steam, leggers and steam driven boats pulling a freight barge (butty)
        sometimes on
        a long rope would have to meet in the tunnel.&nbsp; See David Blagrove,
        &quot;Two Centuries of Service&quot;.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><a href="Tour.htm#topmap"><b><font size="4">8.</font></b></a><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The field to the west is set much higher than the path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There are two points about this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Any truly ancient pathway will tend to be sunken compared to its
        surroundings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case
        however perhaps the need for the engineers to dispose of many hundreds
        of tons of spoil from the Green, to create the tunnel mouth, has
        resulted in this field acquiring extra height.</font></p>

        </span>This section of the path is identified as Nunn Lane and it leads
        to Nun’s Wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
        other side of Nun’s Wood, at Showsley Grounds (then Sewardsley), was a Cistercian Priory which
        was an administrative extension of Delapre Abbey.&nbsp; It was the
        subject of a very revealing 2007 <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/11780526/Sewardsley-Priory-Showsley-Grounds-Towcester">Channel
        4's Time
        Team investigation</a> that showed the old Priory was located just
        behind the existing farmhouse, indeed remains of the building were still visible in
        1830.&nbsp; History records that the Priory
        went through a 150 year period of scandal including witchcraft alleged by Thomas Wake
        of Blisworth so that by
        the time of the dissolution by Henry VIII in 1536 the Priory was very
        poor and there were just four nuns and the Prioress left for
        him to evict.</font></p>

        <font color="#000080">This stretch of
        path runs adjacent to Fisher Brook.&nbsp; In a circa 1800 - 1835* estate map there are shown numbered enclosures
        (#1558 to 1560) that each included access to the stream - see inset
        above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
        were almost certainly rented out by the Duke of Grafton for horse-owners
        who were probably attracted there to provide the horses for the over-hill railway.<br>

        trees the stream crosses under the path (where, 100 years ago, there

        water from old field drains.&nbsp; Fields on both sides of the path
        drain into the stream all the way from the local high point at Nun's
        Wood, on the horizon ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first field on the right
        marks the beginning of neighbouring Easton Neston parish and was called Henwood,
        implying that it was a wood owned by the household (<i>hewan</i>) of a religious community - probably the
        Cistercian Priory.&nbsp; The second field is unnamed but it was occupied
        by an extended Nun's Wood before about 1750.&nbsp; Note pink area in the

        &quot;Sow Gutter Spring&quot; but it is hard to decide where that
        particular spring was located.&nbsp; As the map seems to suggest in
        showing a tiny pond, it was
        probably in the recently cultivated grassland field to the left, but which
        now appears well-drained.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a 1953 RAF aerial survey

        This latter was evidently an assemblage of buildings including a villa
        near</span> the centre of the large field to the

        1970 - 80.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Survey work was
        continued by the Towcester History Society in 2009.&nbsp; </span>There
        now seems to be nothing left to see although probably there were once a cultivated garden and a spring.&nbsp; Whether the villa used to be
        situated in a clearing in Nun's wood or predated the wood altogether

        </span>There is a path that runs along the outside of the wood towards the
        south, keeping to the left of a continuing narrow wood, which will bring the walker
        onto the Showsley Road which, to the left, leads into Shutlanger, a neighbouring village to
        Stoke Bruerne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Shutlanger is
        charming in its quietness and it offers a path (Water Lane) extending south to
        the village of Alderton across a flood plain of the River Tove.&nbsp;
        In fact you will be able to see the broad valley and the gentle bank to
        the south on which Alderton lies nearly three miles away.&nbsp; Imagine that
        in the 1870s through 1900s some men, desperate for work, walked in all weathers from as far
        as Alderton to the ironstone open-mining in fields around Blisworth and
        Gayton.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">In
        the map, the dotted line shows the line taken by Nunn Lane, as indicated
        in a 1946 RAF aerial photograph, which it seems continued around a low
        lying basin (or spring) and descended into the centre of Shutlanger
        opposite the point that Water Lane begins towards Alderton.&nbsp; The
        subject is dealt with in <a href="../Development/South&#32;route.htm"> a separate short article</a> - Nunn Lane is part of
        a trackway extending from the turn at Townsend in Blisworth running more
        or less due south to Alderton and perhaps beyond (eg. Pottersbury and
        the Watling Street).&nbsp; As this path
        enters the field mentioned in the previous paragraph it crosses the
        watershed between the rivers Nene and Tove.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The name <i>Shutlanger</i> derives from Anglo-Saxon <i>Shittle</i> (arrow shaft) <i>Hangra</i> 
        (small wood on a slope).&nbsp; We can identify the slope but no
        particular wood - nevertheless we can picture
        Blisworth's band of bowmen yomping up Nunn Lane to replenish their
        quivers just before one of <a href="../Articles/Wakeseat.html"> Hereward the Wake's</a> sorties.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The shortest path to Stoke Bruerne
        is towards the east at this point. This corresponds to continuing to follow
        the <i> Midshires Way</i> for that is the modern designation also of Nunn Lane.&nbsp;
        The route involves skirting the edge of the field, turning left and
        following field boundaries until the Stoke Road is regained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The section is often very muddy.&nbsp; Note there is marked on
        the map a field pond across the path which is a sure indication of
        the path's antiquity, being a segment of a route probably from
        Pattishall to Salcey (Note: &quot;Midshires&quot; is an imaginary
        figment from the 1980s).</font></p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just before reaching the Stoke Road there is a large mound to the left.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        off for safety reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

        the hedge to the left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a small farm-house (Buttermilk Hall, the gamekeeper’s
        lodge in the 1700s) and beyond it is another large spoil mound surmounted by a
        tall ventilator shaft chimney that is part obscured by trees.</font></p>

        </span>Nearer to the path, appearing to be “in front of” the house,
        can be seen from the same vantage point a very short ventilator chimney
        that was pressed into service in the 1860s to enhance ventilation
        despite the fact it is 12 metres off the line of the tunnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A side-running shaft was provided to make the connection and any
        spoil was removed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        brickwork above ground level was rebuilt in 1982, using the classic blue
        bricks, as part of the tunnel
        repairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shaft is
        located directly over the line for the tunnel that was thought, by some,
        to be abandoned as the engineers strove to avoid problems of collapse
        and inundation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This line <a href="../Tunnel&#32;Story/Tunnel-Story.htm">
        is shown as a green ribbon</a> in the map.</font></p>

        </span>Barely 100 yards of walking along the Stoke Road is required to
        reach this path that is known in Stoke Bruerne parish as the “Horse
        Road”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the field to the right stands an even larger spoil mound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The horse-road is where the walker can truly follow the line of
        the hill railway as it descended at a regular gradient all the way down
        to the canal side in Stoke Bruerne cutting, which is journey’s end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A short distance down this horse-road, on the right, just beyond
        the farmer’s fence, a small wire enclosure can be seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is regarded as unsafe ground where there was once a shaft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The canal manager and engineer, <a href="../Canal/millner.htm"> Thomas
        Millner</a> (1859 - 1943), discovered this
        shaft in 1922 and fortunately gave its precise position.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As it is 61 metres off the line of the tunnel he was unable
        to explain its existence but it is exactly over the aborted tunnel line,
        so its purpose now seems obvious.&nbsp;<o:p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just beyond the dismantled railway bridge
        (a branch of the SMJ network, Towcester to Roade, Olney etc.) and to the left is much
        the same sort of feature as described in <b>15</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is a sunken area in the bushes, lined with moss, which is
        thought to be another shaft to the aborted tunnel line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This area is not fenced off and anyway lies on private land.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For the sake of caution it ought to be said that the rambling
        thickets and woods near the horse-road are all private land and may
        carry risk of sudden subsidence or collapse as has happened a few times in Blisworth
        parish (see <b>4</b>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a
        concern because abandoned headings, shafts and any miscellaneous
        earthworks to control water would probably not be
        brick-lined and therefore very liable to collapse.</font></p>

        </span><b><font size="4">Journey’s end</font></b> – where boat-horses can reunite with their
        barges.&nbsp; A blacksmith, Bob Nightingale, who used to operate at JBJ
        Park, Blisworth now has his workshop here in a little canal-side hut,
        within yards of the tunnel mouth.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">*By the way, the
        term “narrow boat” is sometimes insisted upon, instead of
        &quot;barge&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>However, Thomas Millner referred to the boats
        as <i> barges, </i>and the people as <i>  bargees,</i> as did some old timers in the 1970s who have told their stories of working on
        the canal around 1900.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        term “barge” must be regarded as the <u>traditional</u> name.&nbsp;
        This is a walk that pursues history so perhaps we should preserve it.</font></p>
