        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;

        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>25-02</b>&nbsp; At some time before 1727,<b> </b>the
        area was turned into a meadow by draining a millpond.&nbsp; It has to be
        assumed that the village windmill was available for most of the milling
        duty and another alluvial field would be of high value.&nbsp; At that time, a tiny millpond in one corner
        was retained for part-time water-milling but was abandoned altogether in
        1796 on
        loosing all water due to the arrival of the canal.&nbsp; The canal runs at a slightly raised level&nbsp;
        - to the right of the picture .&nbsp; The field has always been prone to flooding - not helped by
        a high water table imposed by imperfect seals to the canal sides and the
        fact that the mill dam is still there, supporting Chapel Lane.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the period 1945 to 1955 there were regular fairs
        put on in the field by the Strudwick family.&nbsp; In 1967 the field was
        surveyed as potential building land and, despite some concerns expressed
        by local folk over the flooding, contractors went ahead and established
        the streets of Pond Bank and Westbrook.&nbsp; The houses at the lower end
        of the field, nearest to Chapel Lane ie. nearest to the position of the
        mill pond dam, stand on footings which consumed
        more bricks than the houses themselves.</p>

        earlier.</p>
        <p>In the closing year of the European WWII there
        amassed here some Canadian troops with various types of vehicles
        including tanks.&nbsp; Villagers have stories of the tank drivers, in
        mad abandon, modifying fences and hedges in the area - even demolishing
        a barn.&nbsp; The troops were almost
        certainly assembling prior to the D-day push.&nbsp; They <a href="Pond&#32;Bank/candian-soldiers.htm">livened

        field.&nbsp;<b> </b>Date uncertain - probably 1960.&nbsp; The picture shows how much of old Blisworth was set
        upon an edge of ironstone with, in some places, a steep descent to the
        level of the mill pond.&nbsp; The edge peters out to the left of what is
        shown here and becomes indistinguishable with Cliff Hill.&nbsp; To the
        right it can be easily picked up again just below the old rectory,
        visible from the canal towpath.&nbsp; The edge disappears into the
        beginnings of the excavation for the tunnel mouth.</p>

        whole field.&nbsp; The huts on the left are pig-huts and are also
