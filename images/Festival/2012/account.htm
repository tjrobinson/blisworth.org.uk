        is a pleasure to report that &quot;<b>Festival 2012&quot;</b> was bigger and better
        than all previous ones. The organisers, led&nbsp; by the capable Jan
        Andrews, have excelled themselves. The banner at the base of this page
        shows extracts from the program pamphlet. However there lacks detail, in
        that pamphlet, on some aspects of the entertainment that was provided,
        for example by the &quot;The Dog Kennel
        Hill theatre project&quot; but these are covered in the following account.&nbsp;There
        were more venues this year: being a field accessible from the towpath
        south of Mill Bridge (for pony rides and the theatre project) and a
        field next to Candle Bridge designated the &quot;Countryside Arena&quot;
        (carousel, bouncy castle, a woodman and fencer's display along with
        stands put on by Moulton College and the Canal and Rivers Trust).</span></font></p>

      <b>Also topical:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see from Colin Wakelin's tour of celebration
      last month there was<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"> an opportunity to &quot;plug&quot; the fact that <b> Blisworth</b> recently
        won a &quot;Best Village&quot; award thanks to the efforts of a small
      team this year. There is a community
        spirit plainly abroad in the village that is evinced by a number of
      features, most notable of which is this <u> fourth in a series of successful canal festivals.</u>
      <a href="../../Occasions/best&#32;vill.htm">More details</a>.</span></font></p>

      T<font color="#000080">he scope of the festival was much more extensive
      than last year with many new features to entertain.&nbsp; Quite a few
      items that appeared last year also were present this year - the blacksmith
      in a corner by Blisworth House, the miniature bells in the churchyard, a fun item for kids being a laser
      shoot-out
      at the pub lawn, painting faces, the ten or so &quot;Open Village
      Gardens&quot; on the Sunday, the &quot;Funion Bargee&quot; Boat, an opportunity to adopt
      a cuddly toy, a cheese boat, an allotments display and veggy plus
      marmalade plus pickle sale and a
      fudge boat. There was also the usual array of trip boats offering a journey
      by canal to either the tunnel mouth or to Blisworth Arm. In addition, a tradition was
      upheld in presenting a talk at the Chapel. This year the talk was given by
      Hilary Spurrier (see inset), Chm. of the Blisworth Heritage Society, on
      the subject of photographing water - 'Reflections on Water'.&nbsp; She gave examples of photographing the local
      canal spots, so some of it was about Blisworth :o), and she illustrated techniques
      with some shots of breaking waves and icebergs.&nbsp; The Heritage Society
      manned a board on the towpath and as one approached one could hear of
      Henry VII, Grafton, bake-houses and blacksmiths . . Village history was
      also well represented in the tapestry hung in the Chapel Tearoom whilst
      other artistic endeavours along with the late Jim Payler's canal
      photography were on display at the Village Hall.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">A considerable number of new items included
      carousels, placed on the newly opened field by Candle Bridge, some pony rides
      on Blisworth House lawn, a collection of classic vehicles kept by the
      Perrett family, a Red Bus 'Fun Stop' at the Royal Oak and a seemingly
      inexhaustible Pork Roast also at the Royal Oak. There was an <b> RNLI</b> rescue
      boat (an inshore rib, D Class, as some of you will already know) for the youngsters' imagination at the Wharf - important that, so the
      Dads could enjoy the real ale and burger stalls nearby. There were two
      owls and some parrots on show with a guy who would explain to children why
      they look like they do!&nbsp; The quality of the
      trade stalls was better this year with more 'worthwhile' items for sale.
      Live music in the evenings was provided at the Wharf by &quot;Team G&quot; on Saturday and
      &quot;Rapscallion&quot; on Sunday. At the Wharf, the Royal Oak, the
      Village Hall, the Chapel and
      the Church there was food laid on - also there were at least three mobile
      fast-food sales including the ice-cream van that never seemed to move from
      Candle Bridge.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The weather could hardly have been better, except
      for one <i> very</i> brief dampening, and
      attendance was heavy on both afternoons. A field near the Mill was set
      aside for car-parking and was well used, especially on the Sunday. The temporary bright yellow
      signage for both the anxious motorist and the lost pedestrians was
      flawless.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The &quot;Dog Kennel Hill&quot; presentation was
      put on only once - of course I missed it but can describe it as
      essentially a duo: a
      girl with a violin and excellent singing voice and a guy (Pete Boyce - who
      also owns Renfrew) who provided narrative and, later, some storytelling in
      the gardens.&nbsp; Very amusing and rather inspiring was the styled quadrille dancing by the
      &quot;WoadWorks&quot; who appeared at both the Royal Oak and in Blisworth House Gardens, caught on camera below.<br>
      Enough of words! - why not take it in visually . . . .</font></p>
