        <p> <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">It
        is a pleasure to report that &quot;<b>Festival 2013&quot;</b> was a
        success. The weather was kind and we suspect that the attendance was
        rather more than last year - this judged mainly by how far up the free
        parking field the cars extended. </span>The main organisers were again Jan and Alan Andrews
        who had steadily worked on the details throughout the preceding year. Of
        course there was help from members of the Canal partnership committee
        but&nbsp;despite
        some calls for help from other villagers there was not a great deal
        of response - so the success of the weekend is all the more commendable.</font></p>
  </center>
      <p>T<font color="#000080">he scope of the festival was modelled on the
      successes of previous years with some significant addition of features put
      on in the &quot;Festival Field&quot; - that was the field with access just over
      Candle bridge. From a reporter's point of view there was much in common with
      the previous year. For those wishing to have a relaxing time there was, as
      always, the Royal Oak pub and there were walks put on by the Blisworth
      Heritage Society and the Rambler's Association. On the Sunday there were
      nine gardens included in the &quot;<a href="open-gardens.jpg">Open Gardens</a>&quot;
      event in which one could browse and talk 'plants'. There were pony rides
      for the youngsters at the lawn behind Blisworth House and there was the
      usual array of different boats trips on offer on the canal. For those with
      adapted coordination there was the mobile bell tower once again in front of Blisworth Parish Church in the High
      Street and this year there were occasional tunes emanating from it!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">There was </font>no<font color="#000080"> lecture
      in the Baptists chapel this year but Peter
      Bowtell, a water-colourist, showed his excellent work in the Lecture hall. He had
      moved to the Milton Keynes area in 1969 and since then he has made
      numerous studies of North Bucks and the surrounding counties in water-colour, pastel, acrylic colour and pen and ink. His work has been
      exhibited in many public and private galleries in the Midlands including
      Olney. In fact there were many art and/or craft displays throughout the
      main areas for stalls, ie. in the pub field, on the towpath, at Blisworth House
      gardens, in numerous little nooks and even along the High Street. One notable
      display was that of the Blisworth Tapestry Group who have launched this
      year a charity endeavour called &quot;<i>Stitchery-Do</i>&quot; which aims in two or three
      years to raise funds for a Blisworth &quot;old folks &amp; shopping&quot; bus (pictures
      are in the montage panel below).</font></p>
      <p><img src="haymade.jpg" height="190" align="left" width="300">
      <font color="#000080">The &quot;Festival Field&quot; was prepared early on
      in June when a good crop of hay was taken off. The turf was then given a
      mowing. As one can see from the montage of photographs below, there were a considerable number of new items included
      carousels and a bouncy castle. Army folk organised by the Tommy Atkins
      Society were
      there to put on a WWII re-enactment. On Saturday they could make no bangs
      on account of a dog show being held nearby but on Sunday there were mortars etc. (fake ones
      , of course - see below).</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Musical entertainment in the evening down by the
      Wharf, where there was a full bar, was provided by &quot;Coalition&quot;
      with &quot;David&quot; on Saturday and by &quot;Rapscallion&quot; on
      Sunday as was the case for the 2012 Festival. At the Wharf, the Royal Oak, the
      Village Hall, the Chapel and
      the Church there was food laid on - also there were at least three mobile
      fast-food sales stalls including the ice-cream van that never seemed to move from
      Candle Bridge - much the same as for 2012.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#000080"><font size="2">Out of the thousands who came over
      the weekend only a minority would have discovered<br>
      the progress being made to convert the hut by the Tunnel Mouth into a
      useable venue.<br>
      The Blisworth Art Group and the Canal Partnership joined forces in this
      endeavour.</font><br>
