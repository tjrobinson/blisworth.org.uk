      <p>T<font color="#000080">he scope of the festival was larger than last
      year's.&nbsp; Last year's festival was so good that
      it is a little difficult to highlight the success of this festival without
      repetition. The main organisers were again Jan and Alan Andrews with many
      helpers both throughout the preceding year and on the actual days.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">A considerable number of new items were located on the
      Festival Field by Candle Bridge. Also, there were the usual pony rides
      on Blisworth House lawn and the usual collection of classic vehicles kept by the
      Perrett family. Some highlights are photographed separately below while
      there is a melody of images which serve to express the wealth of boats and
      stalls offering antiques, bric-e-brac, books and confections of all sorts. At the Wharf, the Royal Oak, the
      Village Hall, the Chapel and
      the Church there was food laid on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The weather was absolutely brilliant on the Saturday
      but was, thanks mainly to the remnants of Hurricane Bertha, a virtually
      complete wash out on the Sunday - it rained heavily until about 11 o'clock
      and started up again in a discouraging way at 12.30. Eventually, at about
      2.30pm the sun came out for an hour or so but most people had given up and
      some of the stalls had packed up and departed. The Picasso Pantry in the
      village hall traded well, even on Sunday. When I toured a very quiet
      village at 3.00 there was one forlorn character left behind - he, or was
      it a she, would pose with anyone and hug anything. It was last seen
      heading for a trough at the Royal Oak.</font></p>

      Food was a major provision. Apart from the Pub there were two &quot;<i>sit-down
      in comfort </i>places&quot;; Picasso's Pantry in The village hall for
      Plough-mans<br>
      lunches and cream teas, and tea or coffee, and the Baptists' Chapel rooms for much
      the same fare plus the availability of breakfasts. Both were examples of
      dedicated hard working &quot;service with smile&quot;. For food &quot;<i>fresco-style</i>&quot; there were probably a dozen places one could visit - above
      was nice and shady. (btw. these photos were taken very much pre-peak! And
      some didn't mind eating their food off the ground!<br>
