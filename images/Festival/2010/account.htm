        <span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The
        prototype for this festival, full name &quot;Blisworth Canal
        Festival&quot; because it was organised by the Canal Partnership, was
        the <a href="../../Anni-Reopen/25-anniversary.htm"> 25th anniversary celebrations in 2009</a> for the successful completion
        of repairs to Blisworth Tunnel.&nbsp; It was resolved, towards the end
        of those celebrations that Blisworth should have a summer festival every year.&nbsp; The
        Canal Partnership was the natural choice as group organiser because, once again, quite a bit of the focus for activities
        was to be the Wharf and the towpath.&nbsp; But this time a few extra venues
        were to be whole-heartedly committed to joining in the fun.&nbsp; The
        energy of Jan Andrews, being the most noticeable agent in the village in
        organising the event, was the tip of a &quot;well- oiled team&quot; including Alan Andrews,
        Paul Chapman and Sarah Kirkpatrick.&nbsp; They proved that the community can
        have a festival like this every year.&nbsp; Jan noticed in the final run
        up to the weekend that &quot;people were diving into hedges to avoid meeting her&quot;.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        run up to the Festival was covered by a dedicated website, <a href="http://www.blisworthfestival.co.uk/">http://www.blisworthfestival.co.uk/</a>,
        which will stay open for feedback after the event.&nbsp; The event
        spanned a Friday evening and a whole weekend, August 6th to
        8th.&nbsp; &quot;On the days&quot;, the whole thing was a great
        success.&nbsp; On Friday Tad Newton's Jazz Friends filled the Chapel
        Area with pleasant 'trad' music thanks to a warmish breeze that induced
        them to prop open the door to the Lecture Room.&nbsp; They were backed
        up by chilli served in the Coffee Room with a bar laid on by the Royal
        Oak.&nbsp; On the Saturday food was again available not only at the
        Coffee Room but also at the Royal Oak and down on the wharf where
        &quot;Chase&quot;, the local duo, was singing.&nbsp; Again, there were
        bars opened by the Royal Oak.&nbsp; The village coped well thanks to
        extra car parking opened up to accommodate visitors.&nbsp; Even a field,
        with crop already harvested thanks to the recent drought, was available
        near to the wharf.&nbsp; There was even a pig-roast at the Royal Oak this time though some bemoaned
        the possibility it surely couldn't have been quite a <i> whole</i> pig for it sold out rather quickly.</span></font></p>
        <p><img src="Doc&#32;Bull.jpg" align="left" width="153" height="160">
        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Our retired
        resident doctor, Derek Bull, gave us an amusing account of his early
        work since graduating through medical school nearly 60 years ago.&nbsp;
        He slanted his account, as at first a junior partner but later the
        senior partner of the doctors' practice in the village, towards dealing
        with patients, always tricky, rather than medical matters.&nbsp;
        &quot;Children were the champion doctor-haters whilst visiting gypsies preferred
        the district nurse at Gayton, Nurse Edwards, for all troubles and boat-people
        preferred Sister Mary at Stoke Bruerne.&nbsp; <i>When you finally met
        them you have an inckling that they are <u> seriously</u> troubled by health.</i>&nbsp; A few lived in caravans or
        in a particularly memorable campervan below which three angry Alsatians
        were cooped up in compartment with a trap-door in the van floor.&nbsp; <i>I
        stood on the trap-door but fled as soon as I could</i>!&quot;&nbsp; He
        offered a very brief history of Sister Mary's life and work.&nbsp; His <a href="../../people-three.htm#smary">
        account and a couple of
        photographs</a> have been added to the website here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There were boat outings to
        the tunnel mouth and to Blisworth Arm on the trip boat &quot;<i>Elizabeth
        of Glamis</i>&quot;
        from Cosgrove.&nbsp; '<i>Glamis</i> also ran a trip to Bugbrooke on
        Saturday evening that was thoroughly enjoyable.&nbsp; It included a
        reasonably priced bar and pleasant music and demonstrated the calming
        side of living in Blisworth.&nbsp; The return was in darkness and the
        walk along the towpath afterwards revealed that a band and bar was still
        going strong at the wharf at 10.30pm whilst the pub was also being
        well-attended.&nbsp; Sunday was very well attended and it is to be hoped
        that the stall-holders have found the venue of sufficient interest to
        them.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The weekend activities served
        well to illustrate that
        liquid lubricant still encourages sociability in enough village
        residents - cheers!</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="trippanel.jpg" width="825" height="622"></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There were almost countless
        stalls scattered through the village, on the towpath, at the Wharf, at
        the Royal Oak &quot;green&quot;, in the Village Hall, the Chapel
        Lecture Room and even in the barn at the Royal Oak.&nbsp; Second hand books and items of costume jewelry were
        to the fore.&nbsp; There was a &quot;cheese boat&quot; and a restored
        &quot;Raymond&quot; and a display by the Buckingham Canal Society, there were some
        antiques, some modern cards, an artistic photographer and a lace-making
        demonstration, the Blisworth Art Group stall, some wood-turned artistic pieces and a
        couple of displays of the &quot;Rose &amp; Castles&quot; crafts.&nbsp;
        There was even a little paddock set out with a commando course for dogs
        - a tunnel, a few jumps and limbo bar and a &quot;beam&quot; but few
        dogs were that keen - too well fed on &quot;Chum&quot; perhaps judging by some of our
        pavements (<i>gee, thanks</i> visitors).&nbsp; There was not only the frivolous (a bouncy castle and
        some face painting) but also the serious which included displays by the
        organisers of the Community Parish Plan, the village Heritage Society
        and, of course, the Canal Partnership.&nbsp; However, the proliferation of
        bars around the village made such seriousness quite an effort for one or
        two of us!&nbsp; The Heritage Society is always game for showing us
        something new that has historical significance gleaned from the odd cupboard or even an unlikely wardrobe&nbsp;
        - this time there were 1911 plans of
        the school that have now <a href="../../schools.htm#plans">been placed here on the
        website</a>.&nbsp; Finally thanks must go to the hospitality offered at
        the Church - the cakes were wonderful and the tea and coffee just what
        was needed.&nbsp; There was a mock-up miniature Church Bell Tower demonstration in the churchyard which convinced some that a ten year old,
        given the right height box, has far more
        learning capability for bell-ringing than one seven times older.&nbsp; There was also a
        slide show covering the refurbishment of the Church bells in 2004.&nbsp;
        At
        teatime on Sunday the Church group were getting ready to fill the High Street with
        &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There are a few more details
        to report; the take-up of the &quot;Breakfast for Boaters&quot; at the
        Chapel Coffee Room on Sunday morning was very good and attendance was
        well worth the effort at many of the thirteen &quot;open gardens&quot;
        on Sunday though many visitors must have missed altogether the
        allotments with its preserves, produce and plants stalls.</font></p>
