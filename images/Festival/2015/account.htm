        <p><font color="#000080">As reporter for this annual event - this being
        the sixth - one is motivated to identify a theme which can be exploited.
        Well, optimism may be this year's theme in that, in the 'Mirror', a
        review of watery fêtes and festivals around the UK, the Blisworth Canal
        Festival was rated as high as fifth place, just pipping the &quot;Sailing
        around the Scilly Isles&quot; event! We are not that watery, to be
        honest. There were expected to be some more circusey items present in the The Field
        but I missed the stilt-walker on Saturday and then they didn't show up
        on Sunday. Some ferret racing was an absolute hoot and something of a challenge to photograph well . . . But easier
        were the wide range of animal subjects on show in the Blisworth House
        gardens. As before, the main organisers were Jan and Alan Andrews with many
      helpers both throughout the preceding year and on the days.</font></p>
        <p> <font color="#000080">The weather was magnificent on Saturday, a
        little less
        so on Sunday, taking till 2pm to warm up nicely. We didn't have the Sunday washout like last year but
        somehow the crowds had decided Saturday would be their main choice and
        we should blame the Met Office for putting it about we were due for
        scattered rains throughout Sunday. The
        montage below aims to include a few new themes and avoid repeating
        images to be found on previous years. After all, this website is
        supposed to concentrate on history - in the making.</font></p>
        <p><img src="charity.jpg" align="left" height="127" width="260">
        <font color="#000080">Retail trade was judged to be excellent and even
        frenetic in Picasso's Pantry where two days supplies were consumed on
        Saturday. At the Wharf, the Royal Oak, the
      Village Hall, the Chapel and
      the Church there was food laid on - also there were at least three mobile
      fast-food sales. Everything at the Wharf generated funds that were raised
        for the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital - a lovely idea. Every
        where else the stalls'
        fees were aimed at the Canal Partnership who maintain various leisure
        aspects of the Canal margins the year round.</font></p>
        <p><br>
        <font color="#000080">I guess the organisers need to alter the
        centre-fold map in their programme since the entrance to the free field
        car park was relocated on the Towcester Road. The change made a <i>tremendous</i>
        improvement to village congestion however though frustrated some
        motorists who wanted to get to Gayton to take some route by Station
        Road. </font>

        <font color="#000080">
      Live music in the evenings was provided at the Wharf by simply an 'open
      mic'. During the daytime the Scout band proved they were getting better
      and better - a real triumph in training considering the perfectly natural high
      turnover of players.</font></p>
