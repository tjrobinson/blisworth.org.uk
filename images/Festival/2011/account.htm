        Festival 2011</b></span></font></font>
        <p><font color="#000080">Following the same lines as the successful 2010
        Festival, the organisers managed to attract and accommodate many more
        stalls and activities for villagers and visitors.&nbsp; The weather was
        not so kind at first and attendance until mid-afternoon on Saturday seemed rather
        down on last year because of this.&nbsp;Sunday was good though not
        entirely without some rain.&nbsp; Most stall-holders thought the
        attendance made things worthwhile.&nbsp; To the fore in organisation was
        again the splendid efforts of Jan and Alan Andrews (ie. the Canal Partnership) with much
        appreciated help from Bob and Marilyn Daniel (for the use of their
        driveway and garden), the cooperation of the Baptist Chapel and the
        Church and the kindness of Duncan Wakelin in providing a field for
        overspill parking.&nbsp; There is a long list at the foot of this
        article of others who helped considerably.&nbsp; A significant
        improvement on 2010 was the presence of participation events for
        youngsters.&nbsp; In the Eastfield play area there was a model boat pool
        and a combat zone for &quot;troups&quot; with laser-guns.&nbsp; On the
        Royal Oak car park was inserted a &quot;Scary House&quot; and a small
        rides wheel - a miniature fairground no less!</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">As
        before, the
        run up to the Festival was covered by the dedicated website, <a href="http://www.blisworthfestival.co.uk/">http://www.blisworthfestival.co.uk/</a>.&nbsp; The event
        spanned a Friday evening and a whole weekend, August 5th to 7th.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Friday
        there was 1960s music played in the Chapel Lecture Room and this gave an
        opportunity for dance steps that some of the older villagers had not
        practiced in decades - the evening was a great success.&nbsp; The village
        again coped well with the traffic thanks to
        extra car parking opened up on the Gayton Road to accommodate visitors.</font></span>&nbsp;
        <font color="#000080">There were boat outings to
        the tunnel mouth and to Blisworth Arm and there was an evening boat trip
        organised to Rothersthorpe Top Lock.<a name="andy"></a></font></p>
        <p><img src="andy.jpg" align="left" height="160" width="230">
        <font color="#000080">Two talks were given in the Chapel on
        Saturday.&nbsp; One was similar to last year's talk by Dr Bull, covering
        the early start made by the National Health Service and the story of
        Sister Mary at Stoke Bruerne.&nbsp; Andy Newbery, shown in the inset,
        gave a spirited talk on the railways of Blisworth.&nbsp; He gave an
        account of the horse drawn railway over Blisworth Hill that was required,
        temporarily, to join the two halves of the Grand Junction Canal together in the early
        1800s.&nbsp; At that time Blisworth was a major inland port with a busy
        wharf where the large mill building now stands.&nbsp; He then described
        the coming of the railway; the building of the embankment and the sturdy
        archway over the Northampton road, the cutting of the way through rocks
        near Roade and the development of first one then a second station in
        Blisworth which was placed to serve Northampton.&nbsp; After the main
        railway that linked London and Birmingham there were further lines that
        connected Blisworth to Towcester and Banbury and to Northampton.&nbsp;
        The use of lighter railways to move quarried ironstone and limestone to
        various dispatch
        points was also a major feature of Blisworth from 1860 to 1914 with
        horses and from 1945 to 1968 with steam engines.&nbsp; Finally, Andy played a recording of George
        Freeston's covering the Beeching cut that closed Blisworth Station in
        January 1960 after
        over 100 years of service.&nbsp; Andy explained his
        devotion to the railways springing from about three years of his boyhood when
        he could train-spot right down by the railway - something now guarded
        against by high steel fencing.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="mont01.jpg" width="825" height="1068"></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There were almost countless
        stalls scattered through the village, on the towpath, at the Wharf, at
        the Royal Oak &quot;green&quot;, in the Village Hall, the Chapel
        Lecture Room and even in the barn at the Royal Oak.&nbsp; The garden and
        drive area of Blisworth House also contained stalls, including a
        splendid coffee stall, and even one or two
        &quot;visibility triangles&quot; of grass were occupied - one by a fine
        motor cruiser from Milton Keynes Marina but it was not offered in a
        Dutch action as hoped for by some.&nbsp; The Blisworth blacksmith,
        (hitherto from JBJ park but moving to Stoke Bruerne) was set up to make
        small ornaments using a gas powered furnace and his anvil.&nbsp; If
        there is one complaint that might be made it is that, for such an
        extensive show that was so spread out, better and more detailed signing
        was needed - yes, the signing was better than 2010 but there was, this
        time, a greater likelihood that little groups would get overlooked (eg.
        Eastfield, Blisworth House garden and the boats to the south of Mill
        Bridge).</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="mont02.jpg" width="825" height="763"></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The church was a pleasant
        cool and quiet sanctuary for a cup of tea and cake.&nbsp; Those
        interested in family trees could consult an expert while those wondering
        what bell-ringing might be like could have a go on a scaled down cluster
        of bells in the Churchyard.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Helpers who must be mentioned
        are:&nbsp; Ben &amp; Nicky&nbsp;Scarcliffe, Alex Maddisons (a newcomer
        to the village who worked really hard over the weekend and masterminded
        the pub grounds), David Clarke (a boater who e-mailed me&nbsp;to see if
        he could moor and help and found himself given an endless supply of
        jobs, all of which he did with a smile on his face), Ian and Alison
        Clipstone (again boaters who managed the Canal Partnership stand).&nbsp;
        There was a small band of happy people who must be thanked for helping
        all weekend at the wharf - not to forget those keeping up with events at
        the church and the chapel and the Village Hall with their display of
        Art.&nbsp; In so doing, all these contributed so much to the
        festival.&nbsp; The entertainers <i>Woadworks</i>, the Morris group,
        were absolutely brilliant, led by Mike O'Connor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally the
        owners of the ten &quot;Open Gardens&quot; are owed thanks.&nbsp; This
        long list of helpers and participants was furnished by Jan who feels she
        might have forgotten somebody and hopes for forgiveness if she has.</font></p>
