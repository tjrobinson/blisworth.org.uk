        appears to be correct for Stoke Bruerne but not for Blisworth where both
        a water mill and a windmill were operated, well before the canal was built.

        MANOR, WHERE ?</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">It has been said that the Manor house was
        opposite the Church, complying with a general tradition in England in
        being to the north of the Church.&nbsp; Ordnance Survey maps, until
        recently, showed a mark there which was labelled &quot;Manor - site
        of&quot;, being a record which would have dated from about 1850.&nbsp;
        Various articles and publications follow the OS interpretation but a
        teacher at our school just before WWII taught the alternative line that
        is given
        in the following.&nbsp; </font><font color="#0000FF">It is true that a
        big house with Tudor features once stood nearly opposite the Church
        (darker colour) and
        was pulled down in 1896.&nbsp; But it seems that it was merely given the
        name &quot;Manor House&quot; and was probably just a farmhouse.&nbsp;
        The actual Seat, once occupied by the
        Wake family before 1504, would have been an early version of the house behind the
        Church (ie. on the site of Blisworth House) according to a parson questioned by a
        historian clerk in the survey for John Bridges' <i> History and
        Antiquities of the County</i>.&nbsp; The clerk's notes amounts to the one and only record,
        made in 1718, for the Manor
        house location.&nbsp; That a telltale initialled date-stone had been
        covered up provides a plausible reason for the OS
        people not being able to follow up that record.&nbsp; We cannot go into the OS reasoning
        to prove this because all their records relating to
        Northamptonshire
        and many other counties were lost in
        the WWII blitz on Southampton. Who do you believe,
        the parson or the OS?</font></p>

        the garret.&nbsp; </font><font color="#0000FF">Because records have been lost in a fire,
        there are no
        Grafton records further back than 1705.&nbsp; Oldest records are from
        Church and Chapel and from them there is some evidence for a <i> medieval</i>
        punishment cabin or stocks (a &quot;Little Ease&quot;), for wrong-doers, located 170
        yards further down the lane but no known mention of a jail anywhere in the village.&nbsp;There probably <i>was</i>
        one though, somewhere.&nbsp; The village stocks were thought to be at the Courteenhall Road
        corner.</font>

        <p><font color="#000080">One of the two semi-detached stone houses known
        as Grafton Villas; namely, the one nearest to
        the railway archway has been fairly persistently referred to as the station
        office/waiting rooms that served the <i>first</i> railway station at the archway.&nbsp;
        There is even a printed article published somewhere, with a photograph
        of the villas captioned as &quot;The Station&quot;, giving credit to
        this myth.&nbsp; </font><font color="#0000FF">The station building was on the other side
        of the main road with a wooden stairs up to the tracks.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000080">
        </font><font color="#0000FF">Interestingly,
        the house mentioned was tenanted by an early station master who was in
        charge at the <u>second</u> railway station (1843 - 1960)
        and this fact must have caused the
        confusion.</font></p>

        road is occasionally referred to as &quot;Doctor's Corner&quot;.</font><font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;

        <p><font color="#000080">It may be claimed that the origin of
        Blisworth as a settlement relates to the Spa-like qualities of the
        spring water.&nbsp; </font><font color="#0000FF">The 'Domesday' recorded
        name of this village is <i> Blidesworde</i> which
        conveys a ward or enclosure (from <i>worde, worth</i> etc.) with
        properties promoting
        health and well-being (from the OE/old Danish <i>blide</i>).&nbsp; There is an
        early eighteenth century record referring to Ramwell Spring which is described as &quot;<i>a mineral
        water, &amp; accounted good for sore and weak eyes</i>&quot; and which
        descends in the private grounds of the Manor House.&nbsp; From all this
        comes the idea of an invigorating spa.&nbsp; That the current name
        sounds like <i>Bliss,</i>
        which can be associated with well-being, and so on, seems almost too
        coincidental.&nbsp; The more usual interpretation of the village name is that the
        settlement belonged to someone called Blyde.&nbsp; Although this may be false,
        it is tempting to think of Blyde as a notable and aptly named health practitioner
        for Viking expats - then both interpretations could be correct.</font>

        to the Lordship of Blisworth was auctioned off at the &quot;Butchers
        Livery Hall&quot; in London on 3rd November, 1987. The vendor of the
        deeds was the present (12th) Duke of Grafton who lives at Euston Hall,
        Thetford. Although the earliest Lord of the Manor was a Norman endowed
        at the time of Domesday, the 1st Duke of Grafton was created &quot;Lord
        of the Manor&quot; of Blisworth in 1673. These deeds entitle the buyers,
        who were apparently Tony and Denise Georgiou once of Stoke Road, to use
        the title of &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot; - so had we better keep a
        watch to avoid loosing any traditional villagers' rights?&nbsp; </font><font color="#0000FF">Let's
        not worry - the deeds surely have only curiosity value. They probably
        schedule rights to certain common land and an annually reviewed right to
        cultivate strips in certain fields. There may be rulings against such
        things as taking liberties with your stock; whether they be pigs or
        geese etc. and if the 'squire' wishes to hunt in Blisworth without
        obligation to repairs then let's welcome some long awaited
        entertainment. It would be appreciated if the Georgious could allow us
        to photograph the deeds - again, just for curiosity value.</font></font>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The name 'Arm' refers to the arm of
      the Grand Union Canal which joins there and provides a waterways link with
      Northampton.&nbsp; Hence the place was originally called Northampton Arm but for
      some inexplicable reason the name &quot;Gayton Arm&quot; was
      introduced around about the time the <i>first</i> marina called itself
      &quot;Gayton Marina&quot;.&nbsp; This naming was probably done to avoid the inevitable confusion with
      any boatyard or moorings at Blisworth mill.&nbsp; </font><font color="#0000FF">Even some of
      the villagers of Gayton claim the place is part of Gayton but, in fact,
      the whole hamlet and the first part of the waterways arm are all, very
      definitely, in the parish of Blisworth. The highways department wisely
      support the name &quot;Blisworth Arm&quot; for the hamlet.&nbsp;It has
      been pointed out to me (D. Blagrove) that other names in use are &quot;Gayton Junction&quot; as catalogued
      c1928 in Bradshaw's &quot;Canals and Navigable Rivers&quot; and &quot;Arm End&quot; by
      boat-people and the name assigned to the first bridge encountered on the

        ghost which supposedly recalls the true story of a tragedy of an
        entanglement between two boats in the tunnel in 1861 with cries of the
        drowning and choking.&nbsp; There's a variation involving flickering
        candle-light and baby crying at a dimly seen forked junction within the
        tunnel.&nbsp; There's also the fork with some steady lights and a
        feeling of confusion as to which way to steer the boat (no crying
        baby).&nbsp; People say the fork is where an earlier attempt at a tunnel
        line crosses the existing tunnel.<br>
        Away from the tunnel, in the village there's an unhappy chain rattling
        lady on the top floor of a house, once occupied by the Freestons, that is semi-detached to the old post
        office.&nbsp; There is another ghost of no particular
        attribution or behaviour supposedly popping up in an old house in the High Street,
        this claim competing for attention with the assertion that the premises
        were once a billet for Cromwell's soldiers.&nbsp; This house is called
