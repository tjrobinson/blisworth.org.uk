        weekend celebrations at Blisworth on 18th and 19th June
        2005.&nbsp;&nbsp; We enjoyed the days, the community spirit and the
        weather without being inundated by the immense crowds which descended
        upon our sister village, Stoke Bruerne.&nbsp; All pictures are presented at relatively low resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Printed alongside each image is the local photographer's name.

        carefully dredging the canal for a two mile stretch north of the
        tunnel.&nbsp; Everything they found was carefully spread over a couple
        of large fields near Blisworth Arm.&nbsp; The odour of the mud soon

        kids to sit on.&nbsp; In the Stoke Road allotment

        to keep it wound up.
        <p align="center">The gramophone proved to be surprisingly educational.
        Youngsters were amazed at the device with its need for a new needle for each playing of what seemed to be enormous
        black CD's that the
        grownups called 78's.&nbsp; They also were surprised to find that there
        was a different tune on the other side . . .</td>

        the north portal of the tunnel.&nbsp; One asset that Blisworth
        demonstrated throughout the weekend was that anyone could easily get to
        the canal-side!&nbsp; The down-side of being near the tunnel mouth was the layer of diesel fumes accumulated from heavy traffic
        over the previous few days.
