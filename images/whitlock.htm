        Whitlock</b> retired from duties of Sexton n 1956 after 35 years of
        devoted service. He was also a village craftsman and carpenter - the two
        oak book cupboards and the oak processional cross are examples of his
        good workmanship.&nbsp; He was a colourful character and his escapades
        and 'fireside' stories will become legendary.&nbsp; He was the last of
        the village boys to receive their education at the Old Grammar School in
        Courteenhall.&nbsp; He was also a dreadful
        leg-puller and, apparently possessing a &quot;classic&quot;
        Northamptonshire accent, he was taped in interviews by George Freeston.&nbsp;
        A <a href="Articles/Whitlock-memoirs.html">transcription</a> of part of
        one of these interviews is available on this website as is a poem by
        Rev. Ussher about Witty's bellringing.&nbsp; Witty

        known as an organist.&nbsp; The caption picture shows him at the
        Blisworth Church organ which he played when on holiday here.&nbsp; He
        also composed for the organ and orchestra and, in the 1930s
        particularly, performed for the BBC.&nbsp; He also wrote a few short
        pieces and one, which was thought to be lost, has turned up in the
        George Freeston Collection (1996) at the Northampton Record
        Office.&nbsp; Since that piece <a href="Lyrical/percy_whitlock.htm">recalls
        his holiday</a> in Blisworth in pre-WWI times, it has been reproduced on
        this website.&nbsp; He died rather young having had poor health all his
        life.&nbsp; The memory of his life and music is maintained by the Percy
        Whitlock Trust.&nbsp; The secretary of that trust, Malcolm Riley, has
        written a <a href="http://www.percywhitlock.org.uk">biography
        on Percy Whitlock</a>, a copy of which has been kindly given to me and
