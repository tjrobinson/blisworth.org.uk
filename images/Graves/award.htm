        <p style="padding-left: 100"><font SIZE="3" color="#CC0000">Dear all PCC
        clerks/members of church yard maintenance teams,</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100"><font SIZE="3" color="#CC0000">We are
        writing to outline the exciting new structure of the Northamptonshire
        Conservation<br>
        Church yard Award Scheme and how your church yard can play a part. We are
        grateful to<br>
        Bishop Donald for allowing us to use the Diocesan mailing system. For
        those of you who are<br>
        unaware, Bishop Donald is our patron and a staunch supporter of the
        scheme.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100"><font SIZE="3" color="#CC0000">The scheme
        is open to all church yards, big or small, urban and rural and there are
        now<br>
        already 40+ church yards involved in actively working towards making
        their church yard a<br>
        good place for both people and wildlife. We have therefore decided to
        follow up this<br>
        enthusiasm; by creating
        three levels of awards, Bronze, Silver &amp; Gold - <b><i>details
        elsewhere </i></b>-<i><b>&nbsp;<br>
        </b> </i>each with a plaque to display, that your church yard can
        work towards. Therefore<br>
        any church yard, regardless of the size or time-span of their work can
        take part. (The<br>
        competition will still run for all gold level church yards, where they
        may still win the<br>
        hedgehog trophy).</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 100"><font SIZE="3" color="#CC0000">To this end
        we will be assessing all involved church yards over this summer, with an<br>
        awards ceremony to award the gold, silver and bronze plaques (the
        competition<br>
        element will be suspended for one year, until all assessments are
        complete).</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080" size="3">Grass cutting regime&nbsp; </font></b><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        four village churchyards have different regimes.&nbsp; The current <u>Parish
        Churchyard</u> is mown fairly regularly to keep it neat and tidy. The
        mowings are picked up when possible. No sprays or herbicides are being
        used in this area. There are some areas of grass and nettles around the
        perimeter which are left uncut.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" SIZE="3">The <u>Old Parish Graveyard</u> (ie.
        the Cemetery) has a semi-circular grass path which is mown regularly and
        connects to the main new woodchip path. Other areas where we plan to
        have wild flowers will only be mowed at appropriate times. No sprays or
        herbicides are used. The mowings are not collected here.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" SIZE="3">The <u>Baptist New Churchyard</u> is
        mown fairly regularly to keep it neat and tidy. The mowings are
        collected.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" SIZE="3">The <u>Baptist Old Churchyard</u> is
        strimmed once or twice a year and the cut grass is not collected.&nbsp;
        There are native wild flowers growing there.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="3">Planting&nbsp; </font></b><font color="#000080" size="3">Blackthorn,
        Hawthorn and Hazel saplings have recently been planted in both the old
        Churchyard and The Cemetery to form two small hedges. The numbers of
        Snowdrops, Foxgloves, Aconites and Cowslips have been increased by
        division and the sowing of seeds. Verbascum has been planted from
        seedlings on a village allotment. This planting has been done to a
        varying extent in all of the graveyards.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" SIZE="3">We plan to start a wildflower area in
        the <u>Cemetery</u> where grass cuttings will be removed and mowing will
        only take place at appropriate times. Also in this area existing trees
        are being monitored and maintained. The Lime trees have been pollarded,
        the sail area of a large Ash has been reduced and the lower growths
        removed from some trees.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="3">Habitat&nbsp; </font></b><font color="#000080" size="3">The
        Blisworth Scouts and the Benefice Messy Church group have both made bird
        boxes which are being installed. The Benefice children plan to make
        insect boxes next. Log and twig piles are present in all the graveyards.
        A variety of bat species have been seen over a wide area including the
        Cemetery and down to the canal. We are in the process of identifying the
        species present. The provision of bat boxes will be considered but it
        seems roosting sites are plentiful in the village. Lichens are present
        on many of our headstones (which have not been disturbed) and on old
        walls and on an ancient cross. Note that a survey carried out a few years
        back by a villager revealed that <a href="../Church/churchmoss.htm"> many species of moss</a> are doing well in the Church
        yard.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="3">Information </font></b><font color="#000080" size="3">An
        information board has been placed in the porch of the Parish Church.
        Plans are in hand to use an existing (unused) frame (donated by the
        Blisworth Heritage Society) in the Church yard to display
        information about management for wildlife, to list of observed species
        of plants and animals, to record the old graves and provide a history of
        the graveyard. A management plan is being formalised, incorporating what
        we have already achieved and our plans for the future.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" SIZE="3">This application is being put forward,
        as was the case last year, by the Blisworth Parish Plan Progress Team.
        It has the support of our two churches involved and the Parish Council.
        The village survey in 2010 showed that people here are very concerned
        about their environment. This project is one way in which they can be
        involved in the conservation of some of the wide range of habitats
        around our village.</font></p>
