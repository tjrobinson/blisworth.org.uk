        four grave yards in Blisworth have received much more attention in
        recent years, in terms of upkeep and the preservation of wildlife, and
        this has been encouraged by the Northamptonshire Wild Life Trust. Recent
        work has been organised by the Blisworth Parish Plan Progress Team,
        especially in regard to the Cemetery and details are given below.</font></span>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>A Brief Note on
        Nomenclature</b>&nbsp; The grave yards of Blisworth are listed in their
        order of creation in the 1900 map above. The map has some interesting
        warps for which apologies are offered.&nbsp; We refer to the areas,
        highlighted in blue here, as &quot;yards for graves&quot; because that
        is consistent with tradition and because the term 'yard' is still in
        use for space around a building in the UK (churches, school - play area,
        etc.) and in the USA and Australia (the garden and drive space around a
        residence).&nbsp; The Baptist Church was obliged to increase space for
        graves c1950 and that is why Old and New are incorporated in the names.
        The Cemetery has been named as such since its inception and up to around
        1990 (indeed, right up to the present in the <b>SNC</b> mapping that is
        based on the Ordnance Survey). However, in some of the literature that deals with its upkeep and improvement it has been termed &quot;the old
        grave yard, the old church yard or the closed grave yard&quot;.&nbsp; It
        is hoped that such inconsistency does not continue.</font>

        Obviously, on account of its age, there are to be found some of the
        oldest graves here. Notable in this are the chest tombs (box-graves) for the <a href="../Articles/Medieval&#32;Docs.htm">Plowman</a>,
        the Tibbes and the <a href="../Development/brafield.htm"> Brafield
        family</a>. These chest tombs are Grade II listed by EH. The inscriptions have all but gone
        but they were recorded by the historian Bridges in circa 1870 from notes
        acquired for him in 1718 - you could read in full in the Bridges History (Blisworth
        section) at the N.R.O.&nbsp; Both the Brafield and the Plowman family
        are thought to be known in the area before 1650 but, on that date
        (approximately) these families <a href="../Development/manor-summary.htm"> were sold land that had been appropriated
        from the King by Cromwell</a>. A few other individuals, including Tibbes,
        became freeholders at that time. On the restoration of the land to royal
        ownership, with a Duke of Grafton as the <i>honoured</i> owner, these
        former freeholders were granted tenure at favourable terms and became,
        if they were not already, the most influential farming families in the
        village.&nbsp; The chest tombs (box-graves) are all that is left - even some graves
        for these families under the Chancel were tiled over in the Victorian tidying up
        in around
        1855.&nbsp; No one has attempted to research what is left - see George
        Freeston's Church Notes via the search box on the home page.&nbsp; The
        church yard is now the current grave yard for new burials,
        re-established as such in about 1998 by the Rev. J. Cortie.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">There

        Baptist Old Graveyard</b>&nbsp; In 1825 a small Baptist Chapel was built
        with a small parcel of land which extended down a steep field to what <i>was</i>
        the mill-stream.&nbsp; It became the Baptist grave yard and includes many names
        from Victorian Blisworth. The Baptist faith was followed by a majority
        of the working class and some of their 'masters' (ie. business owners etc)
        whereas, certainly in the Victorian era, the Anglican faith was followed
        more by merchants and the 'landed' and the gentry.&nbsp; Because of dangerous ground
        subsidence this grave yard was closed to the public in 2011.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><a href="BAPTIST/oldlayout.htm">The

        The Cemetery</b>&nbsp; The Anglican church yard was thought to be too
        crowded and a cemetery extension was created on land purchased from the
        Duke of Grafton in 1863-4.&nbsp; The Cemetery was in use until
        approximately 1965.&nbsp; It had become distressingly over-grown with
        brush and weeds since then and a number of volunteer clearance parties
        have been motivated in the last 50 years. Latest in these is the currently active group,
        the Parish Plan Progress Team, 2010 - et seq. They have received
        considerable encouragement by the <a href="http://www.wildlifebcn.org/">Northamptonshire
        Wild-Life Trust</a> over the improvements, that have led to a profusion
        in the Cemetery of spring flowers this year.&nbsp; The Parish Plan group
        are applying again for a &quot;Silver Award&quot; based on the village's management of
        all four grave yards, particularly the Cemetery, in the next year having
        won the award for last year.&nbsp; An
        account of this work <a href="award.htm"> is linked here</a>.<br>
