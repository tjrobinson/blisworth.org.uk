        <font color="#000080">John Robert Clarke served in D company 2nd Suffolk Regiment.
        This regiment was part of the British Expeditionary Force who were sent to France and Belgium in WW1. The Battle
        of Le Cateau occurred on 26 August 1914, after the British, French and Belgians retreated from the
        Battle of Mons and set up defensive positions in a fighting withdrawal against the German
        advance at Le Cateau-Cambrésis on 26 August 1914.  In the morning on 26
        August, the Germans arrived and heavily attacked the British.&nbsp; By the afternoon, the right, then left
        flanks of the British, began to break. The arrival of the French cavalry protected the<br>
        left flank. That night, the Allies withdrew to Saint-Quentin. Of the 40,000 Allied men
        fighting at Le Cateau, 7,812 were injured, killed or taken prisoner.&nbsp;
        Several British regiments had even disappeared from the rolls altogether.&nbsp;
        John Robert Clarke was then taken as a POW and subsequently imprisoned in the
        <a href="Other-records.htm#doberitz"> German POW camp</a> in Doberitz,
        Latvia where he eventually died in 1917.&nbsp; The mailing of <a href="Other-records.htm#postcard">postcards
        back to ones family in Britain</a> was evidently allowed at this camp.&nbsp;

        <font color="#000080">According to the war diary. Private Joseph Thomas Clarke
        was building and repairing roads during WW1. He had survived the battle of the Somme which
        had started in 1st July and in which thousands of soldiers were known to be killed,
        wounded or listed as missing. He was killed on the 31st July in Carnoy whilst at a Royal
        Engineers ammo dump by an enemy shell. The place where he was killed is only 44 miles away
        from where his brother was captured by the Germans in 1914.&nbsp; Joseph Thomas Clarke was an uncle to the

        <p><font color="#000080">The <a href="Other-records.htm#bronfay">cemetery</a>, where J T Clarke rests, was begun by French troops in October 1914, but<br>
        little used by them. It was used by Commonwealth troops from August 1915 to February 1917,
        particularly during the Battle of the Somme, when the XIV Corps Main Dressing station,
        for the wounded, was at the farm. During the retreat and advance of 1918, further burials were made and after
        the Armistice, graves of March, August and September 1918, were brought in from the fields
        between Bronfay Farm and Bray.&nbsp; The cemetery was designed by Edwin
        Lutyens.</font></p>
