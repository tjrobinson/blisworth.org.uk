<p><font color="#000080"><b>BLISWORTH GRAMMAR SCHOOL</b> - FROM VICTORIA COUNTY
HISTORY</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Blisworth School, called 'Roger Wake's Chauntre and
Free Scole, was founded by Roger Wake, 'esquyre', who died in 1503, and Lady
Elizabeth his wife, to maintain a priest, 'being a graduate of Oxforth', 'as
well to pray for the souls of the most noble King Henry VII and the founders of
the same as also to keep a free grammar school for all that shall repair
thither.' The chantry-priest-schoolmaster received the whole rental of the
lands, 'as well in Northamptonshere as Bukkinghamshere,' worth £12 4s.,
which, the king's tenths deducted, left a net income of £11.&nbsp;&nbsp; John Curtes, 42
years old, 'well lernyd,' was the schoolmaster, and 'hath at this present 30
schollers.'&nbsp;&nbsp; The lands were confiscated by the crown, the school was continued by
the warrant of the Chantry Commissioners under John Curtes with the fixed
stipend charged on the revenues of the crown in Northamptonshire of £11.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">But the accounts appear to show that no payment was
made to him or any schoolmaster there during Edward VI's time, as the entry of
the amount payable is made in each year at the rate £19, not £11 a year; but
at the end of the entry, where the amount actually paid in the year is stated,
appear the words 'nothing, because not paid.' Probably Curtis had obtained other
preferment and no successor was appointed. In the first year of Philip and Mary
John Orton, 'schoolmaster assigned out of the foundation of the chantry of
Blisworth', was paid £10. For the rest of the reign no entry of any sum paid or
payable to the school can be found. In the reign of Elizabeth the payment was
revived by a decree of the Court of Exchequer, and Philip Colinson,
'Schoolmaster (Ludimagistro) of the Grammar School of Blisworth, received
£11, the full and proper amount. In 1617 Samuel Preston,' 'Schoolmaster of
Blisworthe', received the payment, and the school continued. No later benefactor
came to its rescue. By the time of the Restoration the shrunken value of money
must have made the stipend merely nominal. In 1818 Carlisle could obtain no
information about its condition. At the time of Lord Brougham's Commission all
trace of a grammar school had disappeared, and the stipend has ever since been a
mere nucleus for the salary of an elementary schoolmaster. Such was the result
of Edward VI's great Act for the amendment of chantries by converting them ' to
good and godly uses as in erecting of Grammar Schools to the education of youth
in virtue and learning ' on a foundation which at its inception in 1503 gave its
master a larger salary than that of Eton. Yet, by a strange perversion of
history, in the chronological list of schools furnished by the Endowed Schools
Commission in 1867 Edward VI figures as the founder of the school he brought to
nought.</font></p>

Having read Mr. George Freeston's interesting snippets
on the Blisworth Endowed School in the last edition of History News, Mr. Douglas
Shearing, Lecturer, History of Education, at Nene College, has written to report
the existence of a description of the school as it was in the late seventeenth
century. The document is in the Northamptonshire Record Office, in Miscellaneous
Book 18, un-foliated. (Box X646, Peterborough Diocesan Archives), which Mr. Shearing
has used as a basis for the following description:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Apparently, an inspection was made by Peter Whaley, the
Rural Dean, on 6 December 1686. He was acting on the instructions of the Bishop
of Peterborough, Thomas White and reported that both the schoolhouse and the
dwelling house of the master, Charles Griffiths, were in sad need of repair. A
useless barn, about 18 by 13 feet, built of wattle and mud, had been demolished
by Griffiths, but he had thoughtfully stored the good pieces of old timber in the
schoolroom. There was also a very ruinous cellar-like store, about 12 by 8 feet,
which was let to a butcher whose house adjoined it. Finally, the school had a
close or playground, about 3 roods in size, which was overgrown with ash trees.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Mr. Jonathan Yates, the Rector, thought that the
responsibility to effect repairs was the villager's and not the master's, A sum
of £3 would be sufficient and he was prepared to offer £5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Griffiths showed
Whaley some papers stating that the school was erected during the reign of Henry
the 4th (this seems improbable). Its founder was said to be Roger Wake, who died
in 1503 and the original annual rent from lands given towards maintaining the
school was £12.4.0.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The references in this document to the master are
incorrect. He was, of course, Charles Griffin, who taught at Blisworth from at
least September 1674. A letter of his dated 3 August 1675, to Christopher Wase
at Oxford University, is quoted by W. A. D. Vincent, 'The Grammar Schools: Their
Continuing Tradition, 1660-1714, (1969) p.33.</font></p>
