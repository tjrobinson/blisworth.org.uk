        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        toll-house</a>.&nbsp; That on the left is the twin-villa Grafton Villas (see
        below).&nbsp; Some other drawings include gates across the main road
        and even gates across the lane on the left leading to the station
        (Station Road). 
        <p align="left">This picture may still be in copyright if the artist is
        known. GF has said that it is by George Clarke (1845) and he first
        generated a sketch with all the gates included; not substantiated
        because the&nbsp; Clarke drawings of this scene are missing at the NRO.

      <td width="851" height="66" colspan="2">The style of the locomotives in
        the c1850 picture above (post Grafton Villas) does not seem consistent
        with that of the locomotive in the 1839 engraving below for which there
        is support in the existence of the Stephenson &quot;Alder&quot;.&nbsp;
        What seems to have happened is that George Clarke made a sketch 'on
        location' and added what seemed to be reasonable representations of
        period locomotives later.&nbsp; Perhaps these, above, were the commuter trains
        of the 1850s whilst Alder-like machines, below, were the
        'through-expresses'.&nbsp; Can anyone comment?&nbsp; <a name="adler"></a>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">The above picture is an engraving, scribed
          on a steel plate of size only 105x145mm.&nbsp; It is by Charles Tilt
          (1839) for the 1839 publication by Thomas Roscoe entitled &quot;The
          London and Birmingham Railway&quot;.&nbsp; This print was provided by
          Heaton's of Tilsbury, an antiquarian dealer specialising in art
          works.&nbsp; The dating of a photocopied version (by GF) was doubted at first because the style of the
          locomotive seemed to belong to a later period.&nbsp; However,
          Stephenson's designs marched forward faster than assumed.&nbsp; He
          built in Newcastle a variety of marques for the German market, for
          example the Adler (1834), Jupiter (1837), Pegasus and Hercules (1838),
          and again an Adler (1838).&nbsp; The internet has furnished a drawing
          of an Alder (1835) drawn by Gordon Best in 2001 (<a href="http://steamcad.railfan.net/adler.htm">http://steamcad.railfan.net/adler.htm</a>).&nbsp;
          An enlargement of Tilt's engraving is presented below, taken from the <u>photocopy</u>
          image, with the drawing
          of the Adler superimposed.&nbsp; It may well not be an Adler on the
          rail bridge c1839 but the comparison with the drawing demonstrates
          that a Stephenson's style matches the dating.&nbsp; Another suggestion
          is that the loco is 'Lion' (1839) but the shape of the tender is too
          square.</font>

        judging from the appearance of the clothing and the telegraph
        pole.&nbsp; A feature of the railway embankment is that it was, at the
        outset, planted with a great variety of tree species and some have
        wondered whether it was an 'alphabetic plantation'.&nbsp; Some survive
        today and certainly the wooded appearance behind the Grafton villas is
        clear.&nbsp; The recorded reason for so many trees was to stabilised the
        embankment.&nbsp; See <a href="Railways/drilling-railway.jpg">the
        annexed picture</a> of pile work in winter 2005/6 to stabilise the bank
        once so many trees had been 'tidied' away.<br>
        Of the villas, in c. 1830, &quot;I have chosen the site and set out the
        double cottage this morning, it will have a lodge-like effect and be an ornamental adjunct to the archway
        <u> as well as show off our stone to the best advantage</u>&quot; - in a
        letter between Grafton staff members, the underlining is theirs.&nbsp;
        The stone referred to is that from the Blisworth Stone Works, Stoke
