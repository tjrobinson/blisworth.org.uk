        would anyone want to name a ship after a small Northampshire village
        which has a contact with the open sea only by a Canal capable of passing narrow
        boats and the odd barge?</b>&nbsp; It turns out that <i> two boats</i> named <b>Blisworth</b>,
        one operated from 1940 to 1955 out of Hull and the other from 1957
        onwards probably out of Regent's Lock, were
        both owned by the Grand Union Shipping Company.&nbsp;
        Remembering that the village of Blisworth was once an important inland
        port for all sorts of goods arriving for the Midlands, prior to the
        advent of railways, some senior managers within the Grand Union Canal
        Carrying Company must have decided that their ships should recall that
        early 19th century history.</span></font></p>

        The trail began in one of those Google searches one does and it came up with
        two items which led to others.&nbsp; One was a forum site for the town of Goole, a canal
        port on the River
        Humber in Yorkshire, in which two correspondents in early 2008, pen
        names Pedro and Hamish, discussed old
        times.&nbsp; This Hamish recalled working on the <b>Blisworth</b>.&nbsp; This is an
        extract of what he said - &quot;</font><i><font color="#800080">Greetings Pedro, I was on the <u>Beeding</u> in 53 and again in 55, I guess you are
        aware of her history?&nbsp; She came to a sorry end in the Med after hitting an
        "underwater" object.&nbsp; <a name="scrap run"></a>Talking about old ships, my first trip to sea was on the
        <u><b>Blisworth</b></u>, built in 1902 as the <u>Kathleen</u>.&nbsp; I joined her right out of sea
        school - at the
        dock across the road from the "Melodies" </font> </i><font color="#000080"> (in
        Goole)<i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></font><i><font color="#800080"> She was on the scrap iron run to
        Kiel </font></i><font color="#000080">(c1946 - picking up broken down
        U-boats and other German stuff and, I believe dumping much valuable iron
        in the North Sea)</font><i> <font color="#800080"> at the time and we
        did about four trips and then took off tramping around the coast, all in all a
        great little ship even if we did live forrad.&nbsp; She was sold on and became the <u><b>Holdernidd</b></u> 
        </font></i><font color="#000080"> (with Kettlewell Company Ltd., Goole)<i> 
        </i></font><i> <font color="#800080"> and I left her not too long after her sale.&nbsp;
        Living forrad had its disadvantages.&nbsp; I had to use the same system to get
        aft - wait till she was coming up for air, take your life in your hands
        and leg it for the mid-ships then many times stood my trick at the wheel,
        wet!&nbsp;&nbsp; In the very forward AB's cabin on the <u>Blisworth</u> the top
        bunk only had half a pillow as the rest of the space was taken up by the
        Hawes Pipe - imagine being the 'watch below' when some silly mate let the anchor go!</font></i><font color="#000080">&quot;&nbsp;
        We posted a
        call for Hamish or anyone else on the forum to come back and tell us more about the
        ship, a picture of which (see inset) was kindly supplied by Brian
        Pritchard and taken of the
        ship after renaming to Holdernidd.&nbsp; The other Google find was of some records
        of the Hall Russell Company of Aberdeen, shipbuilders.&nbsp; There are some
        9 photographs dated 1957 of <b> MV Blisworth</b> in an Aberdeen library whose staff were unwilling to let us
        post any of them.&nbsp; There being as many as nine photos demonstrates they
        were taken by the ship-builder after launch and naming.&nbsp; The ship
        was built for
        the Grand Union Company (London) Ltd. - an entirely new build in
        1957.&nbsp; Thus there were two Blisworth vessels, but not extant simultaneously.&nbsp;
        The earlier one was sold and renamed some time before 1953 according to
        Hamish and the other,
        in 1957, was born to take its name and presumably its place in the
        fleet.&nbsp; The younger ship was a good
        size - 1031 tons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span><font color="#000080">We have no idea what the ship was used for but a 'colliery'
        transporter would be a reasonable guess.&nbsp;</font>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#000080">Here is a brief story of
        the <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">operating company with its</span></font></b><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><b>
        proper name Grand Union (Shipping) Ltd:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1920s, the Regents Canal Co. along with a few other
        canal companies amalgamated to form the Grand Union Canal Company.&nbsp;
        In 1936 the Grand Union formed its own
        subsidiaries, the Grand Union (Shipping) Ltd., to operate ships from London, the Grand Union (Stevedoring and Wharfage) Co. Ltd., to
        service the ships.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was probably during the 1930s that
        &quot;Kathleen&quot; was acquired and renamed <b>Blisworth</b> and
        this was clearly the ship that Hamish sailed on.&nbsp; By 1945 the company owned five ships plying backwards and
        forwards to the continent.&nbsp; It was also concerned with shipping from ports on the
        east coast of the British Isles.&nbsp; The Grand Union Company was nationalised in 1948 when it became the British
        Transport Commission.&nbsp; The profitable Grand Union (Shipping) Ltd. was soon
        afterwards sold for £180,000.&nbsp; It had operated the Regents Line which made use of
        a broadened canal connecting the Grand Union Canal to the docks of the Thames,
        specifically the Regents Canal Dock, and provided shipping from
        Teesside and perhaps other east coast ports to the canal network via London.&nbsp;
        From the forum remarks it seems plausible that the Regents Line also
        serviced the inland canal network at Goole.</font></span>

        <font color="#000080">A kind librarian at the Hull
        Central Reference library helped by consulting Lloyds Register and
        discovered that <b>Kathleen</b> was indeed renamed <b>Blisworth</b> in
        1940 when acquired by the Grand Union Shipping Company.&nbsp; By 1950 it
        is sold to Holderness S. S. Co. Ltd (ie. Kettlewells).&nbsp; This old
        ship was finally scrapped in 1955*.&nbsp; &nbsp;
        A seven year gap before the next Blisworth is acquired by the Grand Union
        Company is odd but there is no doubt;</font> <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">t</span><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">he
        new <b>MV Blisworth</b> was commissioned in 1957 to
        either join this fleet or replace one of the elderly carriers.&nbsp; </span>In the
        1957&nbsp; picture of the ship (see inset here) there is evidently a long wheelbase Land-Rover,
        or similar, on its port deck.&nbsp; That would be
        analogous to the ubiquitous 'bike on the narrow boat roof ', no doubt.<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The ship was
        kept on in the fleet until 1968 when it was transferred to the General
        Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. and later was taken on by Lana Maritime and
        registered in Beirut, no doubt a &quot;port of convenience&quot;.&nbsp;
