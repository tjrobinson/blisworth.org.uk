        </span>Sometimes he would return with some of his soldiers hurt (and) if
        they died they always received a fine burial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>Few people are allowed within the stockade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>You would go if there was a job to be done but aside this just
        (reason) you could often hear the music and frolics from within.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

        </span>Hugh when he was very old (handed to) Thomas who seemed in
        charge, it is Thomas that makes any proclamations to the people of the
        vill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>It
        is still remembered that Hugh crusaded for the Church and King, won land

        junior of Thomas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>I was born in the second year of reign of King Edward son of Edward. My
        mother Amy Gyttens once displeased the Wac family, I don't know what was done it
        meant she was in disgrace, free to marry if she could while it is clear
        to me that I am the bastard of Eldrec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>I live with my mother my name Rodrie and I schooled at the house

        with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>I have to learn a trade soon. I choose to be a wood smith
        (carpenter) with old
        Jethro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>He has busy building new houses on the street. Jethro has
        promised to take me Atten Ock (to the oak woods) soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>It is beyond the woods and beyond the boundary of Rode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

        He says it is</span> evil to slay but not so if you are defending yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>He used to say that the Lorde wants to keep the vill against all
        comers and that he is with duties to the King which take us off in army
        (at times). Well, I dream and I like to learn what lies over the nearby
        hills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>I walk and find. I want to show that lines on parchment may
        present a diary of my little (life) travels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>The priest at the church tells me this is a proven method and has
        given me pages and styles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

        my travels, from the great stone pits to the high Snake Moor and thence to the
        Cotes, from the Lorde's fish pool to beyond Attenock near the beginning of the
        Great Forest named Salcett, from the ford to the High Lowne where there
        was once an old temple and from there to the stone pits by Gaiton, from our street to the
        ford and thence through the gate to the vill of Tiffel and thence to
        Tovcastra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>Some say the name for the path in the south is Salstraet and on each
        Ladys Day a merchant passes by to the manor at Salcett. From our street to
        the Myddle town
        thence via the Bridge of our Lady to the fort and beyond, one day to
        Norhamtun, from the street down the hill to our watermill and thence
        into our nether field where our families have the best strips to work for our
        food.<o:p>

        stockade is placed on the hard stone and the edge of&nbsp; it is nearby. The stone pits (are nearby)
        both old and there is a new pit with slates by the wood spring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>If I take the steep path to the High Lowne with the church behind me I see to aside a hole in the ground where we have taken much
        stone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>The stone is dark brown and sometimes red, very heavy and blunts
        the chisels. The French masons have taken many blocks to serve as a
        level base for the torr. They say the ground there is all red stone.
        Soon we meet the crafts people from the south with a head man from
        Sarum. They are brought in by
        Lorde Wac to build the torr for two great bells.<o:p>

        </span>I will start a diary soon on the pages given to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>I am learning how to make a house for the Wood family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>I talk to the blacksmith who shows me how to make a chisel and
        allows me to go to a corner in his forge to make a set and I make my own
        mallet. I watch the jointing smiths making timbers and carving decore and
        tokens. I talk to brother Adam who says I make a high pulpit but he
        hopes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>He also (wants) wooden bases for some statues and I will make

        </span>The miller works for the Lorde and has his trust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>There is a trap for fish near the mill wheel, near the flow gate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        The Lorde has to settle (rights) for the fish and one overseer. </span>The
        dam for the mill has been raised to give a greater pond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>The Lorde thinks we must pay an anglian (foreigner) to build a
        mill that will (use the) wind on the cliff as the vill has more people. There have been some dry years recently and it has been
        difficult to do any milling until nearly November (as we must) wait the
        pond be full.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>The job of making that mill needs a carpenter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>I can fashion the beams, arms and panels of good light woods but
        will need help making the clothes to catch the wind for I know not how.
        Symon needs to breed more oxen and horses but for this he must have more grain
        from the vill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>Alain, the bloom smith, is always busy in wrought repairs to the carts that break
        under load of the stones for the torr.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>We will soon have a French design of cart says the head of masons
        and there are some wagers on which will serve better for stone carrying
        for yet we know of nothing good (from the) French.<o:p>
        Many vills nearby are working hard to have a torr for bells for the
        King demands it so.</o:p>

        I shall have if I do marry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

        me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>They
        know I do not like to fight and I think they wish to prove I am not a
        man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>They
        ask if I can raise my head to prove it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
