        Start:&nbsp; Blisworth.org.uk/images</b>
        was first posted in 2005 in order to show old photos of the village and village people. Such photos were coming to light in large numbers,
        particularly after it was realised that George Freeston had submitted
        documents and photos nine years earlier to the N.R.O. He did not
        publicise that action. All was available to the public at the N.R.O. with free use of a camera
        in the Reading Rooms at the time. Making the photos widely available was
        seen as something that should be controlled by some, as though some
        profit must accrue from their release. Setting up the website was
        opposed by some for that reason but within 3 years such opposition had vanished.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080">The first
        release of the index page is shown below and carried just four links to
        some Photograph Collection Pages</font>

        <img border="0" src="firstpage.jpg" width="560" height="428"></font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The cover (or root) page <b>blisworth.org.uk</b>
        is not included in the account here. It simply displays an assembly of links to other
        societies in the village and as such may not be of much use to anyone!</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Growth in Early
        Years:&nbsp;</b> The number of photograph
        collection pages rapidly rose to over 40 with some in fact divided and
        extended with up to three extra pages
        so that visitors would experience a reasonably speedy loading of each
        page. There was no broadband
        then and
        consequently most of the image files were stripped of their textual
        content to minimise their size. Many contributors of photos were keen that
        they should be water-marked with a title (&quot;Blisworth Images&quot;)
        in order to exercise some control over their use by others. The
        copyright of a majority of the images has never been clarified. With
        recent changes in copyright law the
        availability of high resolution versions of images has been
        discontinued, particularly to 'media' people. Quite a few villagers came forward with photos,
        there are well over 2000 in total, and some also offered their accounts which they either gave verbally or as written
        texts. There was also a large amount of further material which was
        deposited at the N.R.O. after George Freeston died in 2001. Once this
        had been sorted by members of the heritage society, the images and texts in
        this second
        tranche were examined closely. This encouraged a few people to extend
        their own researches and offer their own texts to join the others on-line.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Interest in the website grew
        and by 2007 there were 700 to 900 visitors per month to the pages
        according to &quot;Google Analytics&quot;. About
        half were repeat visitors who represented the core interest whilst the
        others were potential future repeat visitors who may have, however, simply
        landed
        on the site by following a Google search function. These figures have been in
        serious doubt since the research through server logs in June 2015 - see
        below&nbsp;</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The Addition of Topics:</b>&nbsp;
        Subsequent to the main activity of filtering material at the N.R.O. new
        subject pages have been added
        regularly and, for example, stood at a rate of 33 new topics per year in 2009. The rate
        has fallen off in
        recent years and was down to only 8 or 9 new topics about the village in 2014 as shown in the chart&nbsp;
        below (March to March years). There are however a present total of just over 500 topic pages
        (though sometimes they are in groups and closely related). The total size of the
        site in digital terms stands at 530 megabytes.</font>

        <font color="#000080"><b>The Present Position:&nbsp;</b></font> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Whilst
        the list of topics may not extend very much in future the value of the
        website remains chiefly as
        a searchable source on village history. On the entry pages are windows
        which allow the site itself to be searched for occurrences of key words.
        An <u> amazingly little use</u> is made of this search facility by visitors as I
        pointed out in the explanation of the <a href="../Census/Survey/2013-4&#32;opinion&#32;survey.htm">Survey
        Results</a>.</span></font></span>
        <p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><b>A
        Slight Hiccup:</b>&nbsp; Through September to November 2014 the website has been off-line while a
        clean up of orphan pages and a check on the copyright situation was
        carried out. This unfortunately encouraged Google to entirely forget its
        indexing of <i> every</i> page on the site. So when the site was opened again on
        December 1st a site-search produced absolutely nothing on any
        subject at all. Google promptly reactivated its indexing and within 24 hours it had
        processed the large file holding the historical index. Out of interest I repeatedly
        tested the indexing using an appropriate keyword (eg: &quot;freeston&quot; or &quot;dunkley&quot;)
        in the search box,
        over the following many days. I was interested in how long it would
        take Google to
        complete a site index and thus be able to find virtually everything. As shown in the
        chart to the left,
        this 500 megabyte site required at least 60 days. The circumstances were
        somewhat favourable for the Google search &quot;bots&quot;. Evidently they indexed
        the more recent material first and eventually finished with the oldest.
        Then they caught up with some of my very recent editing within 40 days and
        then proceeded to dig deeply for another 20
        days and seemingly finished the task.</span></font></span><p><font color="#000080"><b>About
        George Freeston:</b>&nbsp; One may deduce, erroneously, that the website is
        chiefly about George Freeston in view of the fact that there were found
        ~160 references to either him or his family by Google&nbsp; throughout the total number of
        webpages (~510). A majority arise from the need to cross- reference in order
        to help &quot;ground&quot; our readers so, for example typical of many
        webpages, the one at <a href="stautree.pdf">../chapel/staughtontree.htm</a> 
        has a Note 5 there for something that is merely incidental whilst the webpage has nothing to do
        with George Freeston. Fortunately, Google ranks the finds and tends to
        present the important ones near the top. There are about 45 of these important
        references and they refer in particular to George Freeston's research and articles. In
        <a href="references.htm">this
        document</a> those 45 are highlighted orange. In the same document a blue tab is used to identify
        the top 12 references that are found in Google's ranking, a ranking which proved to be actually rather successful. The
        collected references to Freeston often include the point that a
        particular photograph came from his collection. What is hidden here is
        that he probably collected about 500 photographs - often from
        villagers.</font><p><font color="#000080">I trust that the document that lists a majority of these references, in
        alphabetical order, serves as a fitting tribute to all his work over a
        period of about 45 years; for his talks and his efforts in collecting, rescuing,
        discovering, interviewing and project following, for his writings and his cut-an'-paste
        displays employed often in the village hall or in the church in an age well before domestic computers.
        His graphical skills and his imagination are well represented in his
        view of the old bacon factory included in his 1953 scrapbook. It occupied a strip of land that ran from
        the Stoke Road, adjacent to the Village Hall, back as far as Home Close.
        The view from
        the north that George Freeston offers is very elucidating, <a href="../Bacon&#32;Factory/Northside.htm">see
        this article</a>, but could never have been seen at the time; he has
        removed the foreground clutter of houses along the High Street and thus
        created an easily understandable piece. George must have spent hours on
        presenting the village and its story in this sort of fashion - for the
        villagers. He rarely published for County readers.</font><p align="center"><img border="0" src="baconfactory.jpg" width="900" height="243"><p>
        <span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b>Some
        Thoughts about Google:&nbsp;</b> The
        &quot;curve&quot; of finds versus time shows a pronounced log<sub>10</sub>(t)
        character. Perhaps, if the incidence of keyword locations were perfectly
        random the curve would be a good straight line. That would be expected
        because Google's &quot;reference book&quot; for the website would expand
        during the 60 days
        as various words (both within Google's dictionary and ones that are
        distinct to the website) are accumulated and so the <u> rate</u> at which new finds
        can be positioned and inserted into the book must therefore decrease (linearly?) with elapsed
        time, hence the logarithmic trend. Of the 530MB total on the website,
        only 10MB is text. By the time of index-completion the bots would be
        running through the last bit of text at a rate of about 50 words per
        hour having started at a&nbsp; rate ~1000 words per hour.</span></font></span><p>
        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">By
        now the site is fully indexed and users should encounter no
        difficulties. However, if a page is reported by the browser to be missing then perhaps the
        visitor could report it at <a href="../Contact/in-touch.html">Contact</a>.
        </span></font><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">The present number of visitors
        according to Google Analytics is roughly at the rate of over 1300/month with a surge in May 2015 (60% are non-UK English-speaking) with a
        90% proportion of new visitors.&nbsp; A recent revelation has come from
        an analysis of the web host's server over a period beginning in mid-June
        2015. Previous estimates of the website's activity have been under-estimated, it appears, and it is now estimated the perusal of web pages (htm,
        html) and documents (doc, pdf, etc.) is at the rate of 3600 site access
        sessions per month. The total server delivery is
        ~150000 files/month but the majority must be discounted for a variety of
        reasons (some associated with the frenetic nature of internet activities
        mainly associated with the support for searches, an activity greatly
        enlarged by the prevalence of smart 4G phones. This subject is dealt
        with in more detail below - a paragraph to be completed in due course. An
        indication of the website's hotspots, in respect of interest shown, is
        to be provided below. Separate from
        that is the general conclusion, from search records over the period 2007
        - 2011 (statistics once furnished by Google but that has now ceased) there appears to be
        some fall off in curiosity in the site. This may be a product of a fall off in what is
        effectively the <u> rating</u> of the site by Google and other search companies which might in fact be more
        inclined to favour
        anything <u> new</u> that appears on the internet. For example, a few years ago a
        search for Hereward the Wake on the internet would include this site
        which was fairly new then, admittedly rather remote from the top, but a
        retry carried out recently (using helpful page daisy-chaining software) failed to
        discover this near-decade-old site in the first 500 entries, ie. the
        first 50 pages. The act of
        putting &quot;Blisworth&quot;,
        as well, into the search string, after Hereward, brings this site right to the
        top and this demonstrates a key tip for searchers, which is to always put what you know
        into the search string as the engines make selections by association.</font></span></span>

        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-spacerun: yes"><b>What
        is to Come?</b>&nbsp; </span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080">We need to bear in mind this
        is an infant industry - nothing is constant. The sources of the History of Blisworth is
        the N.R.O. (the prime source, un-catalogued) along with certain
        additional sources such as the
        &quot;cupboards&quot; of the Blisworth Heritage Society, the 1953
        Scrapbook compiled by George Freeston and the follow-up 2013/2014 village
        scrapbook compiled by the BHS. Further additional sources are a personal
        computer <a href="hd.doc">
        hard drive partition</a>  (also the BHS computer) and, of course, this website with its free
        Google-indexed access on the homepage.&nbsp;&nbsp; These sources, although comparatively
        tidy and catalogued, may not be
        available in 25 years time. For how long should we assume Google will be
        able to thoroughly index web sites, in their millions? Indeed the internet, as we now know it, might not
        be available either, possibly ruinously cluttered up with the 'immediate';
        ie. the trash generated by social and
        domestic connections. Anyone skeptical of this pessimism may not have
        noticed the occasional world-wide crashes for over 24 hours of some key
        websites, especially near major shopping days notable in our society.</font></span>
        <p>
        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>Webhost
        Server Activities (also an apology for making this section so long)</b>&nbsp;
        Those companies that construct indexes and surveys for 'app' users
        account for over 90% of the accesses to the server. They are all
        expected to look for a plain text file in the root entitled robots.txt
        to see if there are any off-limits areas of the website they should not
        survey. For the July 2015 assessment month a robots.txt file was written
        to prohibit access to all the 'slideshow'-formatted photo albums. This
        resulted in fewer total accesses, 125989 in fact, of which only 8520
        were valid htm* accesses. Some of these however arose when a search
        engine has suggested a synopsis that was not wanted. The visitor spends
        a few seconds and moves back to the list of search suggestions and, from
        previous experience gained with 'Google Analytics', about 66% of such
        single page sessions are a waste. Single page sessions were detected in
        the access list and 66% were discounted (without knowing <i>which</i>
        66%). This leaves a page access count of about ~7050 in about 3600
        'valid' sessions (ie. an average page/session number of nearly 2). The
        number of htm* pages that were (actually multi-) opened was 708.</span></font><p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In
        the surveys done through June, some 30 ip addresses were stripped from
        the record of accesses because it was evident the interest was in
        creating an 'experts' summary of the website or, by virtue of either
        their using multiple ip addresses to hide their activity or the fact
        that their ip address had already been black-listed for generating spam
        or malware. Often the location of these ip addresses turned out to be in
        Ukraine, Russia, (East) Germany or China. Obviously any access
        originating from bing, yahoo, google etc. or some other group using 'bot',
        'crawler' or 'spider' in their descriptors were stripped from the access
        list and this is why it is fair to say that over 90% of server response
        is of no value in assessing how well the website is working.</span></font><p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        session total (~3600) for the month was divide thus: about 370 were
        routed directly through the home-page and then either the search-box
        (about 80) or one of the general home-page links. All the rest must have
        been directly routed to a page of interest by using Google, or some
        other, with a search string such as &quot;blisworth tunnel&quot; and
        then recognising the page of interest within usually the first ten
        entries. The other methodology (of taking a look at what was available
        on the website) was not favoured. This was indicated by the low number
        of accesses to the historical index (25). Incidently, for those who
        chose the site-search box the interest was divided equally between
        either a person/family or a building or a topic (such as boats,
        oddfellows, post office etc).</span></font><p><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Pages

        over 50%. There
