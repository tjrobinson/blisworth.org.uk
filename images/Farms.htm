         Though labour intensive, animal husbandry was
         possible by families of modest resource whereas extensive arable work
         was too time consuming.&nbsp; Upon the start of WWII
         the need for a rapid expansion in the home food market laid much
         emphasis on arable development, as a quicker route to sufficient food, but this was dependent on availability
         of mechanisation - primarily the tractors from the USA in the first

        <p><b>14-11</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous
        pictures show how farming has changed over the years.&nbsp; This
        emphasizes the other main change where barns of classical style are
        converted into houses.&nbsp; This barn was part of Mr Bonsor's farm and once
        formed part of a large pre-Victorian yard enclosure which bordered the
        road.&nbsp; The tall gable was the subject of a preservation order
        during the conversion - its prominence arises from the change from thatching to
        slates.&nbsp; The farm house is to the right, against the road, and is also visible in a
        few of the pictures in the <a href="Elmtree.htm">Elm Tree Corner</a>
        section.</p>

        <p><b>14-11a</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This shows how
        much of the original barn was considered stable.&nbsp; The sides had to
        be rebuilt and the roof supported on massive RSJ
        &quot;hoops&quot;.&nbsp; The builders were not allowed to lower the
        prominent gable and were not allowed to raise the roof to its
        level.&nbsp; Evidently the prominence left by thatching was a listed
        feature!</p>

      <td width="1214" height="510"><b>14-17</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A change from
        cattle to arable and a move away from horses make the old fashioned low
        buildings of a Victorian farmyard practically useless.&nbsp; Many
        farmers have converted the barns either to housing or to accommodation
        for small businesses.&nbsp; This work was in hand on Blisworth Hill Farm
        in the 1970s.</td>

        Gayton Hill Farm, then occupied by Mr Osborne.&nbsp; The show was
        organised by Ernie Griffiths (family now at Milton Malsor, cattle and
        sheep dealers) and the Rev. Challen.&nbsp; The show was intended as a
        fund raiser to pay for work needed on the church tower but after a few
        years it was discontinued.</td>
