        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;

        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the

        for the saints to intercede with God on behalf of the<br>
        crops, livestock, and fishing. As a sign of sincerity<br>
