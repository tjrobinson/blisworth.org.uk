        <p><b>43-21</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this picture which was part of the
        Wantage Collection shows the apex again and the conclusion is that for
        hundreds of years this was a visible feature of the stonework of the
        tower.&nbsp; It is a crease which matched an old roof, probably of
        tiles, which was set upon the clerestory (clearstory) and the
        conclusion* is that both tower and clerestory are of the same age c.
        1400.&nbsp; When the 1855 roof was built, the crease was incorporated
        into the new structure - totally hidden.</p>

        <p>Having decided to not offer any subscription to the Northamptonshire War
        Memorial Appeal, the Blisworth Parish Council decided that immediate
        needs were paramount.&nbsp; In June 1923 they called for tenders to
        construct a Parish bier so that coffins could be easily wheeled around
        to the deceased&nbsp; house (and later to the church).

         It was for an oak framed bier with modern rubber wheels.&nbsp; Over the
         years it has of course become redundant owing to the prevelance of
         motor hearses.&nbsp; The Parish Council in fact mounted a fund raising
         for the majority of the cash that was required being about £14.&nbsp;

        Blisworth Museum - after all, the Stoke Bruerne &quot;Canal Museum&quot;
        was doing very well at that time.&nbsp; Since George's death in 2001,
        the question of a museum or &quot;heritage centre&quot; has been raised
        again and it will be interesting to see if the enormous cost of a
        suitable accommodation can be borne by some charity.&nbsp; But what
        bothers at least a few villagers is that well over 9/10ths of the
        artifacts that George collected have become lost.&nbsp; There will <i>never
        </i>again be an exhibition of such spendour as the 1981 exhibition.</td>
