<p>Dated approx 1944, Blisworth was visited by a large number of Canadian
soldiers<br>
who were on maneuvres in the fields around the village.&nbsp; With their tanks
they wreaked<br>
occasional devastation to hedges etc.&nbsp; With their relaxed and charming way,
they<br>
certainly impressed the ladies of the village.&nbsp; Picture taken outside the
Robinson home<br>
next door to Stoneacre.</p>
