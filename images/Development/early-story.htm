        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">In the vicinity of Blisworth
        there were Roman towns at Towcester and Northampton.&nbsp; Apart from
        these two towns there were little more than villas or <a href="../Archeology/gayton_dig.htm"> farm houses</a> at intervals of half to one mile.&nbsp; The
        nearest villa to Blisworth was that discovered in 1840, located at the
        highest point on Gayton Hill.&nbsp; We know of nothing of any settlement,
        at any time before the Domesday
        survey,
        in the valley that is now occupied by Blisworth.&nbsp; However, there is
        a little valley running north from the site of the Roman villa with a
        row of fields named &quot;Lowndes&quot;.&nbsp; The name derives from Old Norse
        <i>
        lundr</i>.&nbsp; The word means
        &quot;wood or grove&quot; and often has a sacred
        significance.&nbsp; Maybe this area was the centre of worship, with the
        villa actually being more likely a temple (they are often
        indistinguishable) and its site remaining significant for 500 years.&nbsp;
        Part of the name Blisworth may derive from the Danes too.&nbsp; The
        <a href="../Listed/old_names_of_blisworth.htm">
        name of the village</a>  <i> may well</i> have originated in something of a generic - <i>happy
        healthy homestead </i>which is by no means rare in England for example there are
        many River Blythes with names of villages nearby that seem very familiar
        (Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Northumberland, Scot. Borders and
        Suffolk).&nbsp;&nbsp;Also <i>blyd</i> in Shetland dialect means 'glad'
        and <i>blyth</i> in Orkneys dialect means 'well-being'.&nbsp; Perhaps
        the <i>Englisc</i> (OE) name for the village was Leahworthe (cleared at
        edge of woods) but was altered to Blythesworthe circa 900AD, because of
        its charm, ie. its sheltered location, abundant springs and building
        material, a stream and perhaps, then, over a hundred good acres.&nbsp; There is no doubt Blisworth was taken over by Danes -
        there is a Thorpewood 1 mile from the village centre.</font>

        80 people.&nbsp; The acreage assumed for the villagers, defined as a
        number of ploughs, depends on the
        quality of the land which will generally be considerably poorer than the
        land in the Lord's farm.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 4pt; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0" align="left"><font color="#000080">The
        previous owner of Blisworth, Gytha of Hereford also owned Courteenhall
        and Collingtree and various other parishes near Nobottle according to
        one &quot;Domesday&quot; website.&nbsp; Gytha
        (1025 - 1099) was of Danish stock, the daughter of Sweyn Godwinson (1020 - 1053) who in
        turn was a son of Earl Godwin of Wessex (990 - 1053), the powerful
        brother of King Harold II who lost to the Normans in 1066 at
        Hastings.&nbsp; Blisworth might have been a back-water but there is no
        doubting its Danish royal heritage of 1000 years ago.&nbsp; Gytha was a common
        name, there was also a Gytha of Wessex, one of many daughters of Harold
        II.&nbsp; One suspects a scholarly study of the Danish Royal family 900 - 1066
        might be needed to ascertain Blisworth's ownership for certain.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">The area of the current parish of Blisworth is
        1881 acres (<i>SNC data</i>) and it is bounded by the parishes of Tiffield (to the west), Gayton (northwest), Milton Malsor (north and north-east), Roade (east) and
        Stoke Bruerne with Shutlanger (south) and all these are also Domesday recorded
        settlements except for Gayton.&nbsp; However, at the time of the
        Domesday survey, in 1086, the area was reckoned up to total ~1500 acres.&nbsp; This includes the undetailed Lord's 200 acres. A
        feudal model under the Normans would doubtless develop with time but it
        must have been traumatic for the villagers when William Peverel arrived
        and took over all the best fields.&nbsp; We know that Blisworth eventually
        enjoyed considerable common-land which it shared with Roade and it seems
        that systematic wood clearance on Blisworth Hill (maybe also adjacent to
        Tiffield - Wood Field) provided that area. &nbsp; It also is likely that
        Blisworth would have benefited from rights to keep many swine and run
        them in the wooded areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; The map below indicates
        a possible distribution of the classes of land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
        light orange, 200 acres of the Lord's land and shaded green, woodland.
        Encircled in red is the suggested pseudo-military enclave with the
        village, the water mill, and the fishpool all quite nearby.&nbsp; The
        water course is indicated (well before any canal development).&nbsp; Whether
        this little stream on which a mill was located was called Blythe or Blide is
        not known - the earliest record is for 1718 when it was called Sow Gutter or South Gutter (later Wash Brook, Winter Brook and
        Fishweir or 'Fisher').&nbsp; The area of villeinage cultivation (that which is not darkened) has been chosen with much artistic license/guesswork.&nbsp;
        The location of an enlarging common land area is indicated with some
        reasonable certainty, indeed the use of the King's forest for building
        materials fuel and fodder (incl. acorns at the right time of year) would
        certainly have been agreed on account of the minimal area of common
        land.&nbsp; Whether the enclave had significance at an earlier date than
        1086 cannot be stated but the occurrences of good spring water and a
        helpful topology for defense does promote that idea as being relevant
        perhaps at Roman times.&nbsp; As terrier records are scant there is
        little evidence of a three-field agricultural system being used in
        feudal times, however a two-field system at least, with South and North
        field, seems obvious.&nbsp; It seems
        likely that Blisworth would be isolated from neighbour settlements by a margin of scrubby wasteland or woodland.&nbsp; It is
        suspected there may have been a hamlet at Lowndes as mentioned above.&nbsp;
        That area has
        both Roman (ie. the villa/temple) and <a href="../loundes.htm#cropmarks"> Iron-Age
        connections</a>.&nbsp; To the northern lowland, the woodland was
        probably sparse enough to have been cleared.&nbsp; The soil is generally
        adequate on sand or gravel sub-bars created by some giant river in the
        vale.&nbsp; Where land rises,
        as it does in the other directions, the woodland would be likely to consist
        of heavy timber such as oak and elm.&nbsp; The density and impassability
        of the woodland would be very variable and in some places only a coarse
        grass and a shrub such a gorse may have become established.&nbsp;
        Archeologists find great difficulty in determining whether certain
        tracts of land were woodland in pre-Norman times.&nbsp; The
        clearance of the 700 acres of mostly lowland by the farmers who were enslaved to
        Gytha, the Anglo-Saxon
        lord before the Conquest, would have taken very many decades if not
        centuries beginning at first with one or two families <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#1">attracted
        to the shelter of the valley and the water</a>. In fact, one can easily picture a
        period going back over 9,000 years in which the valley was settled,
        wiped out and then re-settled through many cycles as a Neolithic farming
        style was replacing a hunter-gatherer living style.</font><p align="left"><font color="#000080">Good
        tracks, at least in dry periods, connected the settlement to early Northampton and
        Towcester on the line of what was probably a road built by Romans who
        expected the enslaved Britons to use those roads to market their produce.&nbsp;
        The other tracks may have been little more than green lanes.&nbsp; We have no
        idea how busy the cross-country track called the <a href="../Articles/Roman-Salt-Way.html">Saltway</a> would have become by
        1086.&nbsp; Its easterly progress through the forest could have been
        well maintained if it was required to provide access for heavy timbers (as
        a later
        name of the path suggests - Knock Lane, a 'nock' being a heavy natural
        forked timber useful in timber-framed house construction).</font><p align="left"><font color="#000080">A
        military yomping track line has been suggested by the straight-line coincidence of a
        jetty near the Sun, Moon and Stars Inn, a path across a field and the
        highest point on nearby Gayton Hill.&nbsp; It might have been a <a href="../BBook/BBook.html"> Roman
        military requirement</a> to have access to a lookout over Rothersthorpe
        Vale.&nbsp; It would certainly have been a good idea during the troubled times
        while the boundary of Danelaw was being established.&nbsp;</font></td>

        <font color="#000080">The enclave area is merely suggestive - within
        there would be a special enclosure to accommodate encamped
        armies, gardens, bathing areas and sports such as hunting
        practice.&nbsp; At a closer perimeter there would probably be some
        timber fortifications. The manor house and some associated buildings
        close-by were probably located on the ironstone bluff now occupied by the
        church.&nbsp; At the time of the Norman conquest there was probably no Christian
        church - more likely there would have been a wooden Anglo-Saxon assembly house.&nbsp;
        The commencement of a stone church, and later its bell tower, would have
        a dramatic effect on 'locals' who knew how to build only in
        wood.&nbsp;&nbsp;The incoming masons certainly obtained their stone from
        the Northampton region, judging from the type of limestone and the
        ironstone content of some blocks.&nbsp; However, there is little
        evidence of a likely quarry location.&nbsp; The map is marked Qr
        (ironstone) and Qw (limestone) as likely (worked-out) sites where the
        stone would not have been at considerable depth.&nbsp; Local historians
        have guessed otherwise, placing an early Qw in Wood Field.&nbsp; It cannot be stated with any certainty how much of the resources
        enclosed in the manor lands had been established at the time of the
        Conquest, further than the use of the spring and the
        water mill.&nbsp; <a name="warren"></a>At least, we know that the establishment of a warren
        was granted to Thomas Wake in 1315.&nbsp; Much of the general area had
        been Royal Estates (Crown Land) but in the <a href="manor-summary.htm"> interregnum c. 1650</a> much of
        the Blisworth parish was bought by upwardly-mobile families (<a href="brafield.htm">Brafield</a>,
        Plowman, Crane and Tibbes etc.) who were forced to revert to tenantship
        by 1705 as the Lands were taken back by the Crown and were later
        subsumed into the Honour of Grafton.&nbsp;The area taken by the
        interregnum freeholders remained inclosed lands; the full story of
        inclosure in Blisworth parish is <a href="../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm">given
        here</a>. The paucity of detailed records before c1700,
        apart from the interregnum sale documentation, is unfortunate and means that we have no
        way to show the development of the village until after then, by which
        time the <a href="../mills-blisworth.htm"> millpond</a> was severely silted and
        <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm#1718"> the ancient quarries</a> were
        almost certainly disused (the sites appear farmer-cultivated in the 1729 survey
        maps), the <a href="../Fisher/Fishweir.htm"> fishpool had been drained</a> and the Manor was
        occupied by a Grafton tenant (W. Plowman).</font>
        <p align="left">
        <font color="#000080">At some point a <a href="../mills-blisworth.htm">windmill</a> had been
        established, possibly as early as 1300 since we know of the existence of
        one near Pattishall in 1298.&nbsp; The parish population had risen to
        about 250 by 1700 and by then much woodland had been cleared and
        forthwith inclosed. &nbsp; In c1685, for reasons not clear, two fields on the Tiffield parish
        boundary were assigned to the Blisworth rector; &quot;Pyesnest&quot; ie.
        magpie's nest and &quot;Oxhay&quot;.&nbsp; Oxhay, a boundary field
        useful for overnight resting of oxen, became &quot;Wolsey or
        Wolfey&quot;, obscurely, and the other name degenerated into &quot;Pynus&quot;
        and became the name of a small group of Victorian cottages on the Towcester Road.</font>

        <p align="left">
        <font color="#000080">The 4 acres of common meadow continued as &quot;The
        Green&quot; but in 1798 it was excavated for the entrance to the canal
        tunnel.&nbsp; The name 'The Green' persists as the local address for the
        twin thatched
        cottages at the edge of the village on the Stoke Road.&nbsp; By 1838 the <a href="../Bridges-history.htm#warren"> warren</a>
        had been converted
        into villagers' allotments.&nbsp; The <a href="../Bridges-history.htm">
        spring that is highlighted</a> is that known as Ramwell Spring (1718),
        later called Rannell (1935).&nbsp; Another spring known as Well Spring
        was located near the village centre - there were probably many others.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Many of the stone and once thatched houses at
        &quot;Townend&quot; (Northampton Road), in the High Street and in Stoke Road were built in
        the early 17th century (see account of <a href="../Listed/ListedBldgs.htm">listed
        buildings</a>) and is evidence of a major rebuild period in the village,
        again well before the availability of records.&nbsp; The nature of
        cottages before 1600 can be surmised by comparison with other
        Northamptonshire villages as a mix of stone and timber-based with much
        use of wattle/daub for inside walls and even some of the outside walls
        in the more modest of dwellings.&nbsp; Wattle interior walls have been
        preserved in one house at Townend.&nbsp; Many 17th
        century cottages have a very substantial &quot;ground plate&quot;,
        which, along with a few lower courses, are built with
        a striking dark red/brown ironstone.&nbsp; This base might have been a
        start for the rebuild in the early 17th century - maybe an expert could
        comment.&nbsp; That feature of many cottages implies a medieval source
        of ironstone.&nbsp; It might have come from the site <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm#earlystone">marked
        as an 'outcrop?'</a>, ie. at Qr, or possibly from the edge of the ironstone bluff
        notable near either the <a href="../Canal/rectoryironstone.jpg"> present Old Rectory</a> or the

        impression that Blisworth manor seemed to be a rather 'sought after' asset there

        <p style="padding-left: 80; padding-right: 80" align="left"><font color="#000080">At
        the time of the Domesday Survey William Peverel, the Conqueror's natural
        son, held 3½ hides in Blisworth. On his death in January 1114 the land
        passed to his son William Peverel, who held at the time of the
        Northamptonshire Survey. He forfeited his lands for treason, and at
        Michaelmas 1157 the King granted to Robert de Peissi land in Blisworth
        and Newbottle of the annual value of £43.&nbsp; In 1181 his son Robert held
        Blisworth, but the next year he was succeeded by William, son of Robert.&nbsp;
        In 1189 Richard I granted the over-lordship of Blisworth to his brother
        John, Count of Mortain, who held the Manor until 1194 when the King
        resumed possession of the Honour of Peverel.&nbsp; At that time Mathew de
        Clere held New-bottle and Blisworth, of the yearly value of £43.&nbsp; In
        1199 the King</font> <font color="#000080">granted to William de Ferrers,
        Earl of Derby, the grandson of Margaret, heiress of William Peverel the
        younger, the overlordship of the hundred of Higham, Blisworth and
        Newbottle, in return for the payment of 2,000 marks.&nbsp; </font><i><font color="#0000FF">It was around this
        time that the name given would have actually been Blisworth - before

        Robert de Peissi, sued the Earl of Ferrars for these estates.&nbsp; The case
        was dismissed as Isabel had no right in the land except by her husband,
        who had it by grant of Henry II when the Honour of Peverel was in his
        hands.&nbsp; William de Ferrers died in 1247 and was succeeded by his son
        William, Earl of Derby, who died in 1254 leaving a son Robert, who was
        born in 1239.&nbsp; He received livery of his lands in 1260 but forfeited them
        six years later when the Honour of Peverel was granted to Edmund, Earl
        of Lancaster, and became incorporated in the duchy of Lancaster.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80; padding-right: 80" align="left"><font color="#000080">William
        Earl of Derby granted the Manor of Blisworth and the advowson of the
        church to William Briwerre, to be held as half a fee, the grant being
        confirmed by King John 1199. </font><font color="#0000FF"><i>The next
        year Briwerre was given leave to assart, ie. grub up, 60 acres of
        woodland at Blisworth.&nbsp; In 1212 he was granted timber from the forest of
        Leicestershire to build a cellar and chamber at Blisworth, and the
        following year had a license to cultivate 30 acres more woodland, quit
        of the regard.&nbsp; In 1220 he was granted 24 trunks for posts and squared
        beams and two crooks from Salcey Forest for rebuilding his houses at
        Blisworth.&nbsp; This last may have been cropped out along Knock Lane,
        since crook and nock mean the same.</i> </font><font color="#000080">On
        his death in 1227 the Manor descended to his son William, who died in
        1232, Blisworth being allotted to his widow Joan in dower.&nbsp; The next year
        the Manor was assigned to William de Percy in the name of his daughters,
        the co-heirs of a fifth of the property of William Briwerre.&nbsp; Joan seems
        to have retained possession of the Manor, however, which descended on
        her death in 1205 to Sir Baldwin Wake, the grandson of Isabel de
        Briwerre, sister and co-heir of William, and wife of Baldwin Wake of
        Bourne.&nbsp; He took part with the barons against Henry III, for which
        offence the King granted his Manor of Blisworth to Alan Plugenet, who
        held it in 1266.&nbsp; Sir Baldwin probably redeemed it under the award of
        Kenilworth, and held view of frankpledge and other privileges there in
        1276.</font></p>

        of Cromwell's, 1649 - 1660</a>, land in Blisworth was sold to various
        individuals which spurred on the inclosure of the common fields.&nbsp; Of the many owners of
        the Manor mentioned above it is not known which of them actually lived at the Manor house
        for significant periods, other than the Wakes who lived there for 258
        years.&nbsp; Given a considerable skill in reading ancient manuscripts, lots of spare time and
        free
        travel passes to London, Peterborough and Lincoln, it might be possible to significantly add to this
