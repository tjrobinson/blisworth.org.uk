        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">A <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/Review/snakemore.htm"> previous post here</a>
        discusses the path of a number of ancient routes which pass near to
        Gayton. The Oxenfordwey is identified there as following the short 1286
        perambulation of the Whittlewood forest leaving that forest edge
        somewhere near Brackley, heading for Oxford. Oxenfordwey certainly
        passes through the parish of Greens Norton (first mentioned to me by S.
        Jowers) and this fact has been recently
        supported by a Lidar survey. The path, it is felt certain, passes by a
        curious small square field (meeting area?) on the western edge of
        Tiffield parish and gains the high ground near Snakemore via &quot;Old
        Wilds&quot; and &quot;Gayton Wilds&quot;. It was presumed to head north
        (with some easterly bearing to enter Northampton). The above-linked post
        offers some alternative speculative alignments for the path. This post
        aims to try and crystallise more.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The path is referred to
        passing through &quot;Blisworth Field&quot; (<a href="../../Bridges-history.htm">William
        Taylor 1718</a>) and this is interpreted as following the line of the
        Gayton-Blisworth parish boundary in the area that was to become
        Blisworth Arm. North of Blisworth Arm the line of &quot;The Old Oxford
        Road&quot; runs from Blisworth Arm NNE towards Milton Ham (as stated in
        the Wetton
        Northamptonshire Guide published c. 1870). The following three sections deal
        with the Oxenfordwey path, with as much Lidar support as is available
        from Far Cotton to Greens Norton.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>BLISWORTH ARM to FAR
        COTTON</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Not only is the path stated
        in Wetton's Guide to go near Milton Ham, it is also stated to pass by
        Lady Bridge which crosses the westerly running Wootton Brook. That
        bridge's approximate postion is shown in the map (a red ring) below that
        is based upon Ordnance Survey of c. 1899 and so includes the railways
        and field boundaries that were established c.1800 at the time of the
        country-wide field enclosures.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="milton&#32;ham.jpg" width="816" height="1457"></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">As will be shown in two
        figures hence, the line of the path is assumed to run in the very broad
        hedge shown in the upper-right corner of this map above. The next figure shows
        a Lidar scan for a similar area which adds some suggestions to the speculative dotted line
        in the above diagram passing Milton Ham in the direction of the Lady Bridge.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Oxenfordwey-Ladybr.jpg" width="750" height="850"></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In this diagram the suggested
        line (or alt. lines) are dotted in red. The ring is placed where the <b>modern</b>
        Lady Bridge has been built. A short distance to the NE of the bridge is
        shown, even in Lidar, the heavily tree-ed line of the broad hedge which
        in current times is developed as a leisure walk. The software used to
        generate the Lidar output (Global Mapper v.12) may also show height
        contours and these show that the pronounced northerly run (followed in
        red dots) lies on and follows a ledge of land with the level falling
        away gently to the east. The line eventually collides with an area of housing and
        little may be deduced regarding the details of the path there. To the
        east of the housing, the area is open-space for public leisure use and
        it may be assumed that much earth-working was involved in creating and
        seeding that area.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The next section working
        northwards is not supported by Lidar because of unfortunate gaps in the
        coverage. The map below is also part of Ordnance Survey c.1899 and the line assumed for the path uphill
        from the broad hedge to the &quot;Danes
        Camp&quot; hill-fort ring simply follows an enclosure hedge line. Any alignment
        further into Far Cotton is impossible. It is said that both north and
        south slopes of Hunsbury Hill were once laid out with meadows that were
        used by drovers to store (and restore) stock awaiting a suitable day at
        the Northampton market.&nbsp; Once again the Lady Bridge position is ringed.</font></p>

        map).</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>This
        brief account extends what was <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/Review/snakemore.htm">presented two
        years ago</a> on the various tracks that run near the area that was
        known as Snakemore and referred to in the Royal perambulations, dated
        1286, around Whittlewood Forest. In 2013 it was suggested that the track
        Oxenfordwey would run more-or-less directly from near Gayton Wilds to
        near Blisworth Arm. Various routes have been considered in the light of
        the only clues, until recently, in the form of 1780s field boundaries
        reproduced in OS 1899 mapping. Much of the terrain in the area has been
        badly disturbed by surface ironstone mining which occurred at a time
        mostly before the 1899 mapping. Affected areas are marked with
        &quot;M&quot; in the map. Most hedges have been lost.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        map shows the 1899 mapping over most of the area that spans from The
        Wilds to Blisworth Arm located in an opposite pair of corners. The NE
        corner just includes the GUC bridge next to the Toll House with the new
        marina due south of that bridge. Lidar
        data, augmented with height contour lines (at 5 foot intervals),
        overlays the 1899 layer whilst some 1899 field boundaries are copied into
        an additional layer that lies on top of the Lidar layer. Thus it is
        evident that just two hedges have survived to present times in the NE
        part of the map.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        Lidar rendering is based on light from the SE (141 deg) and so it is evident that the
        Oxenfordwey track, highlighted with a red dotted line, rides high
        (by a subtle amount, it must be stressed) upon the terrain. This was the
        case for a section of the <a href="../../Articles/saltway-east.htm"> Saltway near Salcey Forest</a> and one assumes
        that the track has been strengthened by the addition of stones over the
        blue clay substrate. The track follows a gentle way across the contour
        lines and where the SMJ railway was built there is a pronounce long hump,
        which Oxenfordwey follows and which is cut through by ~3 metres for the
        rail tracks. The field to the north of the railway <u> main</u> line is
        particular flat in appearance because (a) it has been ploughed for ~20
        years and (b) in 2005, entirely covered with canal dredgant to a depth
        of at least 6 inches. Across fields either modified with dredgant or
        mining the line of Oxenfordwey is a matter for speculation. I have
        adopted a path that is helped by scant clues.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A dotted red line to
        the north of The Wilds aligns with the series of &quot;avenue&quot;
        furlong fields mentioned in 2013. This line, as well as the main one
        shown, run close to a spring. The two lines may be an example of
        &quot;path braiding&quot; over the centuries with road to the south
        being the latest braid-line for what is described in Wetton's guide as
        the &quot;Old Oxford road&quot; with reference to Milton Ham, just north
        of Blisworth Arm (as first mentioned in a <a href="../Routes/maptext.htm">general account</a>
        of ancient routes, inc. Oxenfordwey but also covered in the section
        above).</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">North
        of the spring, the line runs near parallel to a 1899 hedge line (which
        the farmer still 'marks' with differing crops) and
        parallel also to what appears to be a second hedge line some 55 yards to
        the east to the first. The kink in the &quot;crosswise&quot; hedge
        (extant) and the 1899 kink is near to this second hedge line, which (one is
        forced to assume) was created since the mining disturbance ~ 1890 - 1910.
        This vestigial hedge line extends to the south right up to the edge of the SP7154
        sq. km. (and, incidentally, there is a second vestigial hedge line that is
        very long, slightly curved, that runs alongside the SMJ rail-track line) It is plausible that the area between hedge lines is yet another
        &quot;avenue&quot; furlong field created around the remains of an
        established pathway at the time of the enclosures, which in Gayton
        parish occurred in ~1780 at the latest. There is no sign of soil
        colouring or terrain profile, detectable by eye. A further supposition is needed and that
        is<b>:</b> after
        the mining, the &quot;second&quot; hedge was re-established and, at some
        point in relatively recent times, was again removed. None of this
        complexity would be necessary if it were not for the two facts, (a) that the
        &quot;crosswise&quot; hedge kink is so positioned and (b) that our proposed
        Oxenfordwey route appears to run straight along the middle of an
        &quot;avenue&quot;.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">There
        is a gap in the &quot;crosswise&quot; hedge roughly where the supposed
        Oxenfordwey line intersects it. By looking north through this gap, the entire line of the route is visible in a gentle incline
        downwards to the barns at <b>B.</b> The other still extant hedge appears to run downhill to the
        west except for a short section adjacent to the road where it is level;
        through that level section the route is clearly shown in the Lidar data.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">So
        far, there has been no exception: a path shown up in Lidar has been
        where the ground is subtly raised, at least on one side, compared with
        the lie of the land nearby. Perhaps such paths are strengthened and any
        mud is lessened by adding stones - hence a raised level. The same
        applies to the Lidar survey (not shown here) for Greens Norton parish
        briefly discussed below.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Continuing
        on the subject of 1899 hedges, the cross hedge a little to the north
        displays a sharp kink near to the Oxenfordwey track (near to the label
        &quot;c&quot;). This suggests an
        additional hedge that might have run parallel with the track. Also, the
        spring in the centre of the fields may have been fenced off and enclosed
        with a stretch of water that collects annually at the point I have
        marked with the letters &quot;Lk&quot; (a small lake). Farmers concerned
        with the welfare of sheep may have designed this fencing arrangement. The
        spring, by the way, is one of 6 marked places, within the scope of
        just this map, where water could be drawn up, all very close to the 400
        feet (125 metres osl) line. The barn next to the road, evidently once equipped with a
        well-pump (<b>P</b>), is now demolished but acquired some fame as &quot;Loundes
        Barn&quot; that was frequently drawn and painted by the Blisworth artist
        Peter Newcombe. The Loundes area, with fields on both sides of the
        Gayton-Blisworth parish boundary, including the deeply grooved hollow,
        should be of interest to archaeologists as it is a locality offering
        water, shelter and a fertile soil to the north with <a href="../../loundes.htm">iron-age
        refuse or burial pits</a> to the south.</span></font></p>
