        map below is an RAF aerial photo taken in 1946 (source: 2010 current
        Google Earth) which shows fields to the west of Nunn Wood with many
        hedges that have now been removed.&nbsp; The course of Nunn Lane is
        familiar but was enclosed by hedges on both sides further south than in
        recent times.&nbsp; At the point where the lane reaches the first
        Shutlanger field, it is clear from the
        location of an ongoing field hedge that the lane continued in a straight
        line and formed a cross trackway over the path that links Tiffield with
        Stoke Bruerne (which passes by the north edge of Nunn Wood).&nbsp;
        Further hedges outline the smooth curve that the lane must have taken
        before continuing down the gentle slope to the main street of Shutlanger
        where it aligned with the end of Water Lane.&nbsp; Water Lane, of
        course, extends past Georgian farm buildings and crosses the Tove and
        emerges at the northern point of the Green in Alderton.&nbsp; It is
        therefore easy to &quot;see&quot;, with little probability of
        contradiction, that Nunn Lane was once part of a trackway extending all
        the way from the Courteenhall Rd corner (current RD2 designation) to
        Alderton Green.&nbsp; Such trackway provides the most convincing
        medieval, indeed also prehistoric, route to the south that also would
        take in Stoke Bruerne via a green side lane.&nbsp; David Blagrove (Stoke
        Bruerne) has pointed out that the route would have had a special
        significance in the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries as it crossed the
        Danelaw-Saxon border at the river and offered a route for trading
        between the regions.&nbsp; Interestingly, Shutlanger is not mentioned in
        Domesday so, presumably, the &quot;control-point&quot; for the route
        would have been at Alderton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        1932 school map and the 1727 Grafton Survey map give some field names which are inserted in red.&nbsp;
        The north-most field had neither a name nor dividing hedges in
        1932.&nbsp; The &quot;living memory&quot; source of Blisworth can
        therefore hardly be expected to perceive that the Nunn Lane proceeded
        straight to Shutlanger.&nbsp; Field boundaries that are given in red are
        from the 1727 map and they show that Nunn Lane was not continued in any
        obvious way at that time.&nbsp; There are however, many instances of 10
        to 20 metre &quot;dog-legging&quot; which indicate the position of an
        ancient trackway and, most mysteriously, the eastern boundary of Long
        Stocking is shown as a zig-zagged line (also in a 1768 map).&nbsp; This
        is most unusual but the most likely interpretation is that it is a
        literal representation of a boundary, rather than vagueness for an
        indistinct boundary as the 18th century mapper used other ways for
        conveying that.&nbsp; Perhaps the boundary is a series of wood-cock nets
        (see <a href="../Farming/fieldnames.htm">cock-shot</a>) or rabbit traps with net tunnels at the apexes.&nbsp;
        The land there would be well-drained, ideal for a &quot;wild&quot;
        warren that might be easily <a href="http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/rabb_warr.htm">purged
        of rabbits using ferrets</a> while beaters would drive the rabbits into
        the nets. An alternative could relate to early archery-hunting for boar
        or deer temporarily trapped in the re-entrant netting, unable to outrun
        a good aim. Interesting is the nearby OE place-name Shittlehangar (Shutlanger)
        that recalls a wooded slope ideal for spars suitable as arrows. Both
        Royal and, later, Grafton hunting groups could have spent time at this
        location.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40; padding-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">The reason for the curved
        line in the 1946 boundary may have been because a straight path would take travellers too
        close to a low lying area near the stream which follows the hedge line
        on the west side of the trackway.&nbsp; Since 2003 the farmer has
        created a large lake (shown in blue) on the line of the stream.&nbsp;
        The curved line also seems to avoid the unusual field marks in Long
        Stocking field.&nbsp; The markings are perfectly clear in a copy of the photo
        without enhancement and might be caused by limestone either in terms of
        outcrops, manual quarrying or walling.&nbsp; The field marks seem to avoid the hedges, a
        more rational statement, and this could be interpreted as evidence that
        the marks were created after the hedges and are therefore unlikely to be
        similar to the prehistoric <a href="../loundes.htm#cropmarks"> circular markings</a> on Gayton Hill, not far
        from The Lowndes.&nbsp; Note that with names such as Stubbs, Stocking
        and Thrif, it is clear that the area was once wooded.&nbsp; It appears
        that the entirety of the strange field markings are within Long Stocking
        - once a wood, so perhaps the limestone was used in some way in the
        making of charcoal.&nbsp; The origin seems less of a puzzle after
        talking to a farmer familiar with the area from the 1940s - see below.</font><p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40; padding-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">The
        name of the 3 acre field called Hitchcraft Piece generates some
        speculation; rather than <i>witchcraft</i> though lets settle for a
        &quot;hurdle-making place&quot;.<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">&nbsp;
        Note the spelling of Blithworth Ditch Furlong.&nbsp; No other source as
        late as 1727 has given the name of our village or fields with that
        spelling.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40; padding-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080"><a name="tanks"></a>Note
        that Nunn Wood, in 1946, had no trees planted in its eastern half.&nbsp; Indeed,
        part of that area looks as though men with a motor cyclist hobby might
        have &quot;carved up&quot; the ground.&nbsp; However, the culprits were <a href="../Pondbank.htm#tanks">Canadians
        with their tanks</a> in 1944.&nbsp; The farmer mentioned above says they
        fairly terrorised the Shutlanger area, driving through fences and
        hedges, shooting up equipment such as a farmer's saw-bench.&nbsp; Live
        ammunition that might damage the tanks wasn't used so
        &quot;minefields&quot; were laid out using house bricks - any depressed
        into the earth were scored against the particular tank.&nbsp; Once a
        week, a staff sergeant would come round taking notes of damages to be
        compensated.&nbsp; This military exercise history, combined with the
        apparent freshness of the field marks might indicate that some were
        trenches, &quot;bunkers&quot; or gun positions for soldiers not lucky
        enough to be driving tanks.&nbsp;</font></center><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font>
