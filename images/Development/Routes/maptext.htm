        </font><font color="#000080"> - a very well known trackway.&nbsp;
        Because of its alignment with the Fort at Hunsbury Hill it is thought
        that the Banbury Lane may have had significance in the Iron Age and
        passing close to the Roman encampment at Pattishall suggests
        significance in Roman times also.&nbsp; For about a mile and half to the
        east of Pattishall, the double hedging in one location and the
        considerable green verges elsewhere point to the trackway being of
        droving significance over a long period.&nbsp; Meadows on and around
        Hunsbury Hill were used in the 16th and 17th centuries as holding
        grounds for cattle waiting to be delivered to Northampton market.<a name="crosses"></a></font>

        Road perhaps to keep a distance from the Wake's estate, see below, was a

        -</font></b><font color="#000080"> The 1781 inclosure map for Tiffield
        includes a reference to a trackway to Buckingham.&nbsp; Pointed out by
        S. Jowers, this could have been a drove route that ran south but avoided
        Towcester whilst offering an extension for traffic moving north from
        Buckingham and from Watling Street into the Oxenford Wey for the Northampton area.&nbsp; The part
        of the route that crosses the Easton Neston estate is a present-day bridleway, so supporting the idea.&nbsp; Beyond the Watling Street the
        path taken is very uncertain.&nbsp; The age of this link, referred to by
        some as Northampton's Buckingham way, is uncertain.&nbsp; A road link
        via Towcester and a part of the Watling Street would have been available
        and maybe Buckingham Way was popular once Towcester and its market had
        become congested.&nbsp;</font>

        <b><font color="#0099FF">Courteenhall Road</font></b><font color="#000080">
        - alongside this road on a 1825 map is a field called Greenway.&nbsp; In
        Eayres map (1791) there is no route connecting to the
        Northampton - Roade road near the Courteenhall estate gates, as there is
        now.&nbsp; What is suggested however is a route, established many years
        before, that passed Thorpwoods
        and emerged in line with the Courteenhall parish boundary (this boundary
        perhaps being the reason for the deviation).&nbsp; Interestingly, the
        emergence of a presumably green lane coincides with a road
        crossing on one of the lines that may have been taken by the Saltway,
        see Saltway-east.&nbsp; In the inset, the dotted heavy line represents the present line of
        Courteenhall Road.&nbsp; The fine dotted line, which is part of the
        mapping, seems to suggest the Saltway; originating just north of
        Tiffield, crossing to Roade at about the right place (for the more
        northerly Saltway-east).&nbsp; The
        alternative, and probably correct, interpretation of the line is that it
        aims to represent the Hundred boundary (Wymersley and Cleley) though the
        drafting is dubious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

        . .Cote Names -</font></b><font color="#000080"> Of significance to
        travellers <img border="0" src="cotes.jpg" width="89" height="16">&nbsp; The name usually conveys a simple barn
        for shelter, just a shelter with no heating&nbsp; especially in the case
        of Caldecote or Caucote.&nbsp; There are, however, so many in the
        Towcester area that it seems sensible to look for an alternative meaning
        for the names but no likely suggestion, other than a cottage, has yet
        been made.&nbsp; Peter Curran suggests that some early French families,
        presumably lodged in the Towcester area, might have been the source in
        that 'cote' in French means '<i>on the border of</i>' or '<i>edge of</i>'
        and, in the case of a river, '<i>on the bank(s) of </i>'.&nbsp; Hence
        adding 'cote' at least makes England feel like home.&nbsp; The
        Pattishall History article on Pattishall's website however refers to
        place name derivation such as Dalscote being derived from Doer's Cot and
        originating to before the Norman Conquest.&nbsp; A &quot;French
        connection&quot; seems unlikely as a result and &quot;cot&quot;
        signifies abode etc.&nbsp; The majority of cotes shown here lie within
        Whittlewood.&nbsp; It is therefore tempting to take the meaning as
        'cut', referring to a clearance of trees, for a settlement.&nbsp; Note
        &quot;-cutt&quot; is the spelling in the 1767 Grafton Map of Greens
        Norton (see below).</font></p>

        in terms of defining a boundary, in Charters
        for the Parish of Badby (944AD) and Stowe (956AD).&nbsp; The route can
        be identified with some probability as far as the Kislingbury to
        Rothersthorpe road. At this point the indications are that it headed
        directly to the Iron Age Hill fort at Hunsbury.&nbsp; The mapped extensions to the Fort on Hunsbury Hill and to Kislingbury are guesses

        follows the line.&nbsp; In the 1286 forest
        perambulations it was referred to and &quot;the King's Highway leading
        to Northampton&quot;.&nbsp; It was presumably an alternative to the
        Oxenford Wey in travelling from Oxford to Northampton.&nbsp; It aligns
        remarkably well with the Roman traces of a road found in two places between the villa (Gayton)
        and Blisworth Arm.&nbsp; In other words
        the High Street of Tiffield could well have been Roman.&nbsp; A moot
        point is whether or not this highway was &quot;braided&quot; with the
        route assumed for Oxenford Wey, for example by a route across the fields between
        south-Tiffield and Duncote.</font><p align="left" style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><font color="#0099FF"><b>London
        Road </b>

        Pagnall is known as the London Road.&nbsp; However, an earlier route for
        the London road was through Piddington but was extended to include
        Horton, for the convenience of eminent occupants there, when it was
        upgraded to a turnpike, presumably in the 18th century [1].&nbsp; The
        track given on the map merely provides a reminder.</font>

        </font><font color="#000080">- an interesting alignment of old buildings
        and a pathway suggest a straight path from the area near Blisworth
        Church Tower to the highest point on Gayton Hill, which is adjacent to the
        site of the Roman villa on the Blisworth - Gayton parish boundary.&nbsp;
        An account on this pathway, thought to be a Roman track up to a
        &quot;Look Out&quot; or a temple, is given on the <a href="../../BBook/BBook.html#romans">Blisworth
        Website</a>.</font><p align="left" style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><font color="#0099FF"><b>Nunn
        Lane South </b></font><font color="#000080">- Nunn Lane is still present
        as a green lane that must have provided access to a number of fields in
        the south part of the parish.&nbsp; In Victorian times it appeared to
        terminate abruptly at the parish boundary with Shutlanger.&nbsp;
        However, after studying Shutlanger Grafton maps from 1727 it is very
        likely that the green lane continued into Shutlanger and aligned with
        Water Lane there.&nbsp; Thus a route is suggested; south from the turn
        in Blisworth on the Northampton road probably as far as Pottersbury.&nbsp;
        The traverse of the River Tove is conjectural.&nbsp; Before the turnpikes to Towcester and Stony Stratford, this route may
        have been significant.&nbsp; There is a little more detail in the <a href="../South&#32;route.htm">Blisworth
        website article</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a <a href="http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/gaz/gazweb2.html">gazetteer
        on line</a> compiled by Dr. S. Letters for early markets established in
        the country. Remarkably, this route passed by two markets: Milton Malsor
        (</font><font color="#0000FF">A market by Charter Tues; first 27 May
        1305, by K Edw I to Edward Charles. To be held at the manor. A fair by

        that the route was significant.&nbsp;</font>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><font color="#000080"> A recent discussion (Peter Curran) has
        introduced the possibility, in the search for a south extending route
        from Northampton that passes 'between' the parishes of Easton Neston and
        Stoke Bruerne, that this trackway was once known as a Northampton
        Portway.&nbsp; Perhaps significantly, it carries four of the six Crosses
        listed in 1718.&nbsp; Far more likely is the possibility that &quot;le
        Portwey&quot; of c1290 was the main road from Northampton, through
        Hulcote, Easton and across the market place at Towcester - a late-Saxon
        road, part of the link established between the burgs of Oxford and
        Northampton.</font>

        the wood is very nearly exactly aligned with the &quot;Fort&quot; circle
        on Hunsbury Hill, in fact aligned within 50 yards to the west of the
        fort circle.&nbsp; Perhaps the arrangement helped in signalling across
        Rothesthorpe Vale - but in what era?</font>

        </font><font color="#000080">- this ancient route, a King's Highway in
        medieval times, thought to have been
        created by Offa (c600AD) to promote his expanding kingdom, has received very
        little publicity beyond being identified in the Royal Forest Perambulations
        (1298) as the western boundary of the Whittlewood Forest, with respect
        to <a href="forest_perambulations.htm"> the <u>short</u>  perambulation</a>.&nbsp; The
        perambulation cites route-points from the centre of
        Brackley, through &quot;the vills
        of&quot; Wappenham, Slapton, Bradden, and Duncote together with Burcote, Tiffield and then as
        far north as Snakesmore which we identify as the Gayton Wild (Fields)
        extending over half mile both east to west and north to south.&nbsp; The road has also been identified
        as &quot;The Old Oxford Road&quot; at Milton Ham [2], in terms of a
        traced line, so we must assume a
        plausible route to Oxford, following southwest from Bradden, in the mapping.&nbsp; It is also
        picked up in Wetton's guide and associated with the Roman villa
        (temple?) in Gayton, it being Landmark No. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wetton's guide
        [2] also mention the route crossing the Watling
        Street by Duncote and heading northeast on the boundary of Tiffield
        parish.&nbsp; Eighteenth century maps give no indication of this
        trackway, from which we conclude it was superceded by other roads maybe
        as early as 1500, except perhaps near Milton and Tiffield. Recent work with the
        support of Lidar data on the Oxenford wey is reported in a <a href="../Review/Oxenford.htm">separate 
        article. </a></font>
        <p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><img src="oxenf-watling.jpg" align="left" width="230" height="240">
        <font color="#000080">The above-mentioned Watling Street crossing is the route favoured
        by S. Jowers and it is particularly interesting because it comes to a
        small field that appears to be a meeting place (Landmark No. 4) right
        alongside a Folly Farm with its Roman associations [3, page 351].&nbsp;
        In Eyres map (1791) there is no crossing shown but there is
        a turn off that bifurcates in favour of Caldecote (Caucote) and Astcote
        (Ascote).&nbsp;
        The inset shows the portion of Eyres that suggests the crossing
        (suggested in yellow) was to
        the north of Caldecote and hence the route very likely misses the centre of
        Tiffield, see Kingsway above, indeed it skirted Tiffield parish (1850s
        data) with the meeting field located next to Tiffield parish but
        actually in Pattishall parish.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ogilby's strip maps (1674)
        show no turnings but indicate an inn at just about the right location -
        the &quot;Man and Boy Bush&quot;.&nbsp; The Eyres inset seems to show
        the 2 mile mark at the turn.&nbsp; From the centre of Towcester the
        distances to the modern Caldecote turn, the modern Duncote turn and the
        pathway assumed in the main map are 1.3<sup>5</sup>, 1.8<sup>0</sup> and
        2.1<sup>0</sup> miles respectively.&nbsp; A 1767 map of the parish of
        Greens Norton shows a band of common land extended from the Watling
        Street towards the centre of the village, bisecting Burcote from Duncott
        (as suggested by the wording of the 1286 forest perambulation).&nbsp;
        Clearly, Oxenford Wey passed through this common land but in 1767 there
        was no trace of it shown in the mapping and no extension towards Bradden
        was visible; the track had evidently disintegrated by then, leaving
        vestigial traces amongst partial (and private) inclosures of that parish
        (<a href="1767&#32;in&#32;Greens&#32;Norton.jpg">see map here</a>) and note
        that the series of red dots in the map trace out the obvious line of the
        route from 1m Lidar relief which is now available (Sept 2015). Evidently
        the position of the stream crossing was taken incorrectly for the
        guessed yellow line trace.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><font color="#000080">The
        date of the general disintegration of the Oxenford Wey (est. 600AD)
        which was eventually totally superceded by a 'new' road from Oxford to
        Northampton (est. late Saxon or c 1140) is yet to be clearly established
        (see previous paragraph).&nbsp; Population accumulation at the borders
        of the latter road were of course dominated by Towcester and the move to
        maintain it would have come from that town.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30">
        <font color="#000080">North of the meeting field there is
        some confusion as to where the Oxenford Wey goes (there is <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/Review/snakemore.htm">a
        recent review</a> of this situation).&nbsp; However, because
        of the references to the Roman Villa and the Milton Ham vicinity, the
        route possibly switched east along the Saltway for about a mile and then
        turned north.&nbsp; An alternative that is being pursued at present is
        that the route runs near the &quot;Old Wilds&quot; and traverses the
        flat Snakemore to New Wilds and thence to the area of the Villa. This
        detail will be presented with a separate map. A further possibility is
        that the route proceeded straight on
        towards Gayton and this results in a possible conflict when comparing
        the route assumed for &quot;the old Oxford Road&quot;.&nbsp; Over the
        years, it is entirely likely that route braiding has occurred.&nbsp; The
        line marked with a ? mark is the one adopted in later documents on this

        brook crossing at Lady Bridge (now is a part of the West Hunsbury suburb
        of Northampton) and the Nene crossing at South Bridge in Far Cotton,
        Northampton.&nbsp; The route through Gayton and Kislingbury includes the
        river crossing at Kislingbury.&nbsp; It is a few miles longer,
        however.&nbsp; The decision on which path to take is beautifully
        portrayed in this account of a journey taken in 1154 by a court
        entourage, written imaginatively but offered without sources, by Mr. Dave Blackburn (Duston) and placed on the <a href="http://www.duston.org.uk/history.htm">Duston
        History website</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><i><font color="#000080">The entourage left Westminster, via Bermondsey, Oxford,
        travelling north to Northampton, one of the regional seats of government
        . . . The royal party would keep to the high ground, crossing the
        Watling Street north of Towcester, with its floods, mists, and marshes
        to use the old Roman road via Tiffield, making for the Duston fords, or
        the bridge at Kislingbury. Since it was December, it was likely that the
        notorious river valleys of the River Nene at Northampton would be
        impassable.&nbsp; The only bridges of any age, today, are at Kislingbury
        or, on the northern arm, the Brampton Causeway, both many miles from
        Northampton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></i><i> <font color="#000080"> </font><font color="#FF0000"> Reports
        reached the royal party, as they waited at the old meeting field at
        Tiffield, that access was indeed difficult. Even the new south bridge
        across Marsh Island was doubtful, so Kislingbury it would be.</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp; The
        crossing was without too much trouble, the large group proceeding over
        Kislingbury Bridge, along the north bank of the Nene on&nbsp; the Salt
        road via Upton . . . </font> </i><font color="#000080">The entire passage is well worth reading but
        the implication here is that, at one time, in this case the
        mid-12th century, the route options in winter were important as was the meeting
        field for any considerable entourage.</font></p>

        Information gleaned for Bridges History in 1718 confirms the Saltway
        near a limestone quarry in Blisworth.&nbsp; It also passed just south of
        the manorial fish pool.&nbsp; Notable is the fact that Saltways tend to avoid
        the large towns and this implies that, by tradition, the salt merchants
        must have had set points along the route for them to stop and trade;
        furthermore news of their arrival must have been &quot;sent
        forward&quot; in some manner.&nbsp; There is a little more to say about the Saltway - see the above section

        example; if an ancient charter related to Ravenstone or Olney were to
        mention a 'Salt Toll' (as is the case for Litchborough - [5] which is on the
        well established part of the Saltway) then it would be clear that the more

        Saltway was used for the part of the way, then the Great Way would have
        been used (ideas from D. Hayward), branching a few miles west of
        Farthingstone, and finally that would be parted in favour of a river crossing
        at Kislingbury.</font>

        -</font></b><font color="#000080"> is evidently a vicinity to the south
        of Gayton, on the high ground, referred to in the 1298 <a href="forest_perambulations.htm">Whittlewood
        Forest Perambulations</a> and defined here with a green shading, which define the extent of the forest (law)
        by describing a counterclockwise path following the perimeter.&nbsp;
        After following the road through Tiffield and arriving at Snakemore, the
        paths around the &quot;small&quot; perambulation and the
        &quot;large&quot; perambulation follow different courses; the former
        runs south on the Oxenford Wey while the latter strikes further
        north-west
        before turning south along the lane through Pattishall towards Cold
        Higham.&nbsp; Snakemore is bordered by a relatively
        recently named region &quot;Blacky More&quot;, being a field in the
        north-east corner of Tiffield parish, and by a place currently known as
        &quot;Gayton Wilds&quot; to the north.&nbsp; These names strongly
        suggest, together, a rather large area of waste ground in medieval
        times.&nbsp; Peter Curran (Stoke Bruerne) is convinced Snakemore is a
        meeting place for at least five roads; Saltway east and west, the King's
        highway running through Tiffield and the Oxenford Wey south and
        north.&nbsp; One might regard the last mentioned as dividing near Gayton
        to offer a road directly to Northampton or one towards Kislingbury.&nbsp;
        The boundaries, both short and long, for Whittlewood as interpreted by
        the text given in the above-mentioned link are lined finely in
        purple.&nbsp; Note that the long perambulation passes by &quot;Dinscote&quot;
        (where there was recorded a windmill in 1286 - one of the earliest?) and
        it seems likely that Dinscote is now the farm named </font><b><font color="#0099FF">Descote</font></b><font color="#000080">.

        the topological aspects, Snakemore is interesting in that it was farmed
        in Roman times.&nbsp; This has been determined by the CLASP group, see <a href="../../Archeology/gayton_dig.htm">article</a>
        giving a little detail on the first of <i>three</i> Roman homesteads
        discovered in the area.&nbsp; Incidentally, the field name &quot;Blacky&quot;
        also indicates a Roman connection and approximately ten years ago a
        Saxon gold horde was
        discovered on its eastern margin.&nbsp; By way of a diversion; in

        Road routes</b>
        </font><font color="#000080"> - an old route between Northampton and
        Towcester (with its modern A43 designation) passed over Hunsbury Hill,
        then through the centre of Midelton (Milton Malsor), followed
        Blisworth's High Street and the path indicated in red to emerge near the
        church and Town Hall at Towcester.&nbsp; It was said to continue towards
        Handley [7] - hence the crude tentative route lined in yellow.&nbsp; The
        line is said to have been established c 1140 and near Northampton given
        the title c1290 of 'Le Portwey'.&nbsp;&nbsp; A map drawn by John Cary in 1793,
        see inset, appears to 'catch' the line of the Towcester Road in
        transition as it joins Watling Street north of the North bridge (Landmark
        No.7).&nbsp; Perhaps
        the bridge across the River Tove near the church was compromised.&nbsp; Note
        the river naming here
        - Troue River, probably an error.&nbsp; The map also suggests, by the
        drawn widths of the roads, that a way bypassing just south* of Tiffield was
        the route favoured between Towcester and Northampton presumably for a
        combination of reasons such as unreliable river crossing and obstructed
        passage near Easton Neston.&nbsp; This aerial picture of the <a href="towcester&#32;station&#32;area.jpg">Towcester
        Station area</a> shows that the extra road connection (orange dotted
        line from the right) nevertheless passed quite close to the River Tove
        and made connection with the Tiffield lane near to the Watling
        Street.&nbsp; At
        the time the road was realigned and given turnpike status in c1795, it was
        shifted a little to the west for the convenience and privacy of the occupants of Easton
        Neston Manor.&nbsp; This new junction at Towcester, over a new bridge,
        was 250 yards further north that the church but south of the North
        bridge.&nbsp; This turnpike road has also been superceded by a new
        dual carriageway bypass established in 2000, intersecting the minor road to Tiffield and truncating
        Greens Norton Lane west of the Watling Street.</font>

        <p style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><font color="#000080">*
        the bypassing route near Tiffield is more clearly shown on Bryant's map
        (1827) and can be traced in the existing bridleways in the area.</font>

        Railway Arch to the bridge over the Canal.&nbsp; It is thought this plan
        was introduced with the rendering of the road as a turnpike but resident
        tradesmen with businesses in the High Street would have strenuously
        tried to veto it.&nbsp; Blisworth eventually obtained an even better
        bypass in 2000!</font><p align="left" style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><font color="#0099FF"><b>Viatores
