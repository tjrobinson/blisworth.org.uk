      map of the canal and the tunnel toll road over Blisworth Hill was prepared
      in 1807 to show the Duke of Grafton's land that was involved in the
      building of the canal link.&nbsp; It was discovered at the NRO and was <a href="../../Tunnel&#32;Toll/tunneltoll.htm">posted
      on this website</a> in 2006 with a number of notes regarding field and
      road names, the layout of Blisworth Arm and the location of the toll gate
      and gauge associated with the overhill road, being now known as the Stoke
      Road. At the time of posting there was not much interest in the ridge and
      furrow layout adjacent to the canal shown in the map and the details of
      layout for that part of the feudal field, North Field, was overlooked
      completely.&nbsp; In 2013 the omission was recognised and the prominent
      green lane, of width much the same as the width of the canal, ie. 30 feet
      or more, was noticed along with the &quot;green fields&quot; near the area of
      the Loundes that were obviously cow-pasture rather than arable. A section
      of the map is shown in the inset.</font></span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><b>Tracks,
        baulks and waterways</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the modern OS section below the
        green lane <b>GL</b> and the cow-pasture <b>Cp</b> are inserted based upon a
        successful fit of the 1807 map onto the OS map. The green lane is speculatively
        extended both to the north and the south to aid suggestions on what the
        green lane was used for.&nbsp; Also the direction of the ridge and
        furrow markings are transferred to the OS map as is the alignment of a
        baulk, labelled <b> Bk</b> at both ends, that divides a part of the field
        called Ford
        Close (shown pink). The ridge and furrow details for Ford Close
        correspond exactly with that seen today and this encourages one to insert a
        number of other baulks (or hedges) in the field to the west of the canal
        according to a layout <a href="../../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm"> shown in 1727
        mapping</a>. The point of these added baulk
        details is to show how the green lane aligns with known baulks to the
        south-west of the canal whilst the alignment to the north-east seem
        fairly obvious.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">The baulk <b>Bk</b>
        is important because it was <u> the one</u> considered to serve as a field road
        in 1794 and provoked the canal company to provide a small bridge for it
        over the canal. Perhaps at this location the lie of the canal in the
        field was level enough for a bridge.&nbsp; The bridge soon acquired the
        name Stockwell Bridge because of the prominent well <b>W</b> in the
        adjacent field. The bridge was soon rebuilt c.1840 with a new alignment to serve
        an extension to Ford Lane that became, in the 1970s,
        Station Road and built by Stephenson's railway company. The well <b>W</b> is now served from
        underground pipes and is drained by pipe joined to the mill stream at the
        culvert that passes under the railway embankment. When Ford Lane was
        established it extended only as far as entering the Close (<a href="../../Comp_Mapping/details.htm">see
        details</a>) and this was
        at some time before the 1727 mapping. How it joined with the baulks is
        suggested with green dotted lines.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Extending into
        the North Field were two water courses, namely the millstream <b>Ms</b>
        and the lesser one that drains from the spring <b>Sp</b> past the
        Loundes area. The green lane avoids both of these courses and this seems
        entirely appropriate in maintaining a dry enough surface. Note the small
        elevated patch of land on which, according to crop-mark appearance, was
        located a pre-historic enclosure <b>Em</b> (HER data). In medieval times
        this small hump would be a useful site for temporary folding of
        plough-beasts rather than walking them back to the village every
        night.&nbsp; To take advantage of the alluvial quality of the soil near
        the streams, one might expect a substantial use of grass
        land, cow-pasture etc., in the area of the North field, rather than
        ridge and furrow arable, and thus the green lane would have a role as a
        stock movement path.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">There are just a
        few key questions.&nbsp; Can the
        broad green lane be married into a medieval scenario?&nbsp; Could this
        lane have a local farming purpose at times before the medieval
        period?&nbsp; Could it be, instead, a part of a cross parish or cross
        country route?&nbsp; Comment is made against these three possibilities
        but there seems no conclusion with robust defense at the moment. We are
        left preferring a short medieval green lane with rather grand
        proportions! This is a feature that is not common judging from its
        presence in only three of the manorial maps in David Hall's book (The
        Open Fields of Northamptonshire), for Brixworth, Doddington and Mears
        Ashby.</font></p>

        <p><img src="lidar-evidence.jpg" align="left" height="387" width="85">
        <font color="#000080"><b>Medieval
        Relevance?</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; One cannot help be struck by the width of
        this lane.&nbsp; For a connection to the south the key baulks were <b>Lnd</b> and <b>Ln</b> - both by
        1727 developed into trackways, the former of which acquired the name
        Loundes Lane and is still extant.&nbsp; Even though it was recently
        decorated with wind-driven snow, the field topography near to <b>Lnd</b>
        revealed nothing of interest.&nbsp; This is not surprising as the arable
        farming cycles in that field over the past 45 years have totally
        obliterated any ridge and furrow patterns. The 1808 Blisworth award map shows the lane
        in fact terminated at <b>Lt</b> in a complex arrangement of tiny
        paddocks perhaps for stock holding (plough-beasts?) with a convenient
        well <b>W</b> nearby.&nbsp; Note that there was no road near to that
        location before c.1840.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Regarding the
        north, one can see that the ridge and furrow patterns do indeed fade out at <b>Rf.&nbsp;</b>
        The photograph below, which was taken from the vicinity of <b>Rf</b>, shows a view along the western side
        of the hedge <b>H</b>, <b> </b>which is evidently pretty ancient.&nbsp; There is
        evidence there that the lane was indeed <i>not</i><b> </b>on the
        western side (in grassland) because the ridge and furrow patterns
        closely approach the hedge. Unfortunately the field on the eastern side
        of <b>H</b> is arable
        and conceals any sign of a path that is clearly shown was there in
        1808.&nbsp; In the photograph there is an indication that the lane once
        reached as far as the Milton to Gayton road at the
        point where a car (ringed) is parked at a broad field gateway, at <b>Mg</b>
        in the map.&nbsp; Before c.1980, the parish boundary coincided with that
        road and with a section of the mill stream.&nbsp; The red chevron outlines the field
        corner at <b>Fc </b>and the possible vestiges of the lane is suggested by
        the snow patches running up past a substantial oak tree towards <b>Mg</b>.
        &nbsp;In fact the
        award map shows the green lane
        extending only about two thirds of the way to the road before petering
        out as it gradually broadened to over 40
        yards, in other words the lane ceased in the vicinity the ground's lowest level.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Thus the 1808
        limits of the green lane seem clear enough and sensible in a feudal
        context.&nbsp; Did the lane once reach significantly further distances? The inset to the paragraphs above shows the extent to
        which there are notable residues of the green lane visible in the DSM
        (Digital Surface Model) imagery from
        Bluesky-World. The green markings show a rather wavy course for the lane
        whilst the strictures of the 1820s inclosure field demarcation overlay it.
        It is evident that the lane picked up and followed the low-lying ground and
        perhaps remained as not only a conduit but also a piece of watery
        meadow, or common cow pasture, that could not be otherwise cultivated ie.
        in support of the outlines in the award map. There
        is no evidence in the DSM data for an extension to the lane either to the south or the
        north of the indications in the inset map. However, because of the severance
        of the north fields from the village by canal and railway in the early
        19C, we know there must have been access to the northern most fields
        from the Milton-Gayton road.&nbsp; DSM data show a vestigial hedge line
        coincident with the oak tree but it is not clear to which side of that
        hedge the access track once went.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="looking&#32;north.jpg" width="870" height="357"></p>
        <p>
        <font color="#000080">Although there is no evidence of extensions to the
        lane either to the north or south the possibility of it in a
        pre-medieval context is discussed below.</font></p>
        <p>
        <font color="#000080"><b>For Local
        Pre-medieval Farming?</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; One's attention is drawn to the HER data for a
        complex of crop-mark features <b>Cm</b> on the high ground.&nbsp; There
        are a number of <a href="../../loundes.htm#cropmarks">aerial photos of
        these</a> and some time ago one of the circular features was explored by
        digging (see HER notes) with the impression given of a stone lined pit in
        which were a number of animal bones.&nbsp; Linear features were
        described as ditches.&nbsp; That the features arose from pre-historical
        activity is definite but no-one dare say there was a settlement at that
        place.&nbsp; For a settlement the location would in fact score well (a). on defense as,
        from a nearby point <b>Mx</b>, one has an unhindered 360º view, (b). on a good water
        supply <b>Sp</b> nearby and (c). on well-drained land nearby for
        cultivation and scrub on the slopes to the north that would have provided building
        materials.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Also possibly
        relevant is the Roman villa/temple at <b>V</b>, discovered in 1840. In
        the map it
        is encircled by a pink HER 'embrasure' <b>Vf</b> that covers most of the Roman finds
        nearby.&nbsp; Also Roman was the road metalling found at <b>Am</b>; two sites
        that if joined and extrapolated seem to show that the villa was probably accessed from the north-east.&nbsp;
        A south-west extension,
        eg. <b>Aa</b>, is discussed in the next section.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Near the villa,
        the parish boundary (shown by dots) cranks around a pentagonal little
        field, see fine blue lines, on the Gayton side. Aligned with the crank
        in the parish line there was a baulk that
        ran up and joined <b>Lnd</b>.&nbsp; This baulk was rather less perfectly
        aligned in 1808 than indicated in the modern OS map. Perhaps
        the green lane followed that line anyway and passed near to the villa.&nbsp; If
        so then maybe the idea of a Roman green lane running from a Roman
        farm/villa down to the valley of meadows has some credibility.&nbsp;
        Note that the new A43 has taken away, in its cutting through the hilltop, any
        possibility of further exploration of this area.&nbsp; Furthermore, any
        remains of a green lane alongside the pre-historic features has probably been
        obliterated by the 19C and 20C ironstone
        open mine workings.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Part of a
        Longer Range Route?</b>&nbsp; To judge feasibility we could compare
        routes according to their worst grades that would be involved climbing onto the
        high ground near the villa from either the Vale of Rothersthorpe or the valley in which
        Blisworth is situated. The easiest grade of about 1 in 15 is
        offered by the Blisworth - Towcester road, next easiest are the
        &quot;Villa&quot; Lane <b>Va</b> and the Courteenhall - Gayton Lane <b>Gc</b>
        at 1 in
        10.&nbsp; Our 'new' candidate would have suffered a grade of 1 in 6 or 7
        but apparently so did the Roman road <b>A</b> ascending from Blisworth Arm.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Other factors
        which count against this green lane having been significant are (a). no
        soil-marks have been noted, (b). the route is very close to a minor
        run-off valley and (c). as mentioned above, there is nothing apparent in the
        DSM data.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">North-south
        connections that have been sought in the past are (i). the &quot;Oxenfordwey&quot;
        (an Oxford to Northampton route prior to an establish route via
        Towcester and close to Brackley) and (ii). the &quot;Kings Highway&quot;
        from Towcester to Northampton via Tiffield.&nbsp; Both of these routes
        are referred to in the <a href="../Routes/forest_perambulations.htm">1286
        Whittlewood perambulations</a>. The former one is also known as the
        Oxford Road, picked up near Blisworth Arm in Wetton's 1849 Guide.&nbsp;
        A good deal of this is discussed <a href="../Routes/maptext.htm">in
        another article on this website</a> and, to be brief here, our new green
        lane does not have much to offer other than, to the north, it could
        satisfactorily link through Milton Ham to Northampton and, in so doing,
        circumnavigate Blisworth Arm. It is important to note that the <a href="../../Bridges-history.htm">1718
        preparation</a> for Bridge's History includes a reference to the Oxford
        Road passing through &quot;this (<i>Blisworth's</i>) field&quot; but a <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/Review/snakemore.htm">detailed
        attempted alignment</a> for the road places it passing through the very
        edge of the parish. Unfortunately there is no scope in
        exploring the line of the lane on the north side of the Milton to Gayton
        road because of extensive 20C sand extraction and in c.1800 (Milton award
        map), before any extraction, there was no suggestion of an extension of
        the lane into Milton parish.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Because the Oxenfordwey must
        pass through Greens Norton common (as stated in the perambulations) it cannot reasonable pass through
        Tiffield and nor may it pass near Towcester.&nbsp; To the south west of
        Watling Street the 'battle of the routes' for Oxford must have been won
        by the &quot;A43&quot;, over the Oxenfordwey, in early medieval times yet,
        nearer to Northampton, it is noted in Wetton known locally as the Oxford
        Road, still then extant but
        only just.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">The status of
        the Roman road <b>A</b> is unsatisfactory because of a lack of data.&nbsp; The HER references quote the two
        metalling find spots and infer a route that would serve as a fore-runner
        to link Northampton to Towcester and, in so doing, would pass via
        Hulcote, it is suggested.&nbsp; But the alignment is for Tiffield, with
        a likely meeting with the Watling Street at Spital Br., so the
        natural assumption would be to continue the route over the crossroads to
        the south of the villa, crank the route onto the Saltway aka. Salt Lane* (west) and
        crank again (south) onto the King's Highway for Tiffield.&nbsp;
        Alternatively, the necessary cranks might involve using route <b>Aa</b>
        to the vicinity of the Gayton Wilds cottages and then, as one option, a direct step across Snakemore and thus into the King's
        Highway.&nbsp; That direct step is labelled the 'Road to
        Towcester' in a 1791 map of certain fields** in the parish of Gayton.&nbsp;
        Another option would be to traverse Snakemore to the vicinity of the
        &quot;Old Wilds&quot; and follow into Oxenfordwey (this alignment is
        explained in a map being prepared in August 2013). Because of 19C mining disturbances there is no way the
        alignment <b>Aa</b> can be substantiated - other than by the fact it
        aligns with paths for a little of the way.&nbsp; To follow this discussion
        the reader is referred to the map that can be opened in the <a href="../Routes/maptext.htm">&quot;routes&quot;
        article</a>.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">* this is the first (and only) pre-20C Northamptonshire reference to
        this Droitwich saltway<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; which identifies it in a map (1791 - see document reference
        next under **).<br>
        ** no Gayton
        award map is available. Useful 1791 estate maps are in <b>NRO</b> document <b>YZ 2183</b>.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">The
        &quot;Villa&quot; lane shows a fair amount of hollowing that indicates
        use over a considerable time as does the King's Highway as it descends into
        Tiffield. In a 1791 plan of the &quot;Lowndes&quot; fields in Gayton parish, the Villa Lane
        is described as the public market road to Towcester, the word 'public'
        implying it was toll free. It seems unlikely that the green lane under
        discussion here would have made a connection onto the Villa Lane.</font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>
