        <p><font color="#000080">PLANS TO BUILD a housing estate complete with a
        new village hall and football pitch are causing an uproar in Blisworth.&nbsp;
        Last night parish councillors met behind closed doors to discuss the new
        proposals, which they believe break structure plan guidelines.&nbsp; The
        planning application submitted to South Northants District Council by a
        Kettering company of architects and surveyors proposes the building of
        53 houses, 28 bungalows, a football club pavilion and children's play
        area as well as the football pitch and village hall.&nbsp; The
        development would be located off Courteenhall Road, next to Blisworth
        Lodge.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">If Gotch Saunders and Surridge's application is
        passed by the council it will make a &quot;nonsense&quot; of a
        previously drawn up structure plan which restricts development in the
        area, say villagers. The structure plan states that no further housing
        can be built within the Blisworth boundaries until 2001.&nbsp; Btisworth
        Parish Council were due to consider the application at an emergency
        committee meeting last night. They will make a recommendation to South
        North-ants planning department who will in turn make a recommendation to
        the planning committee.&nbsp; Blisworth Parish Clerk, Tony Lack,
        admitted that he was not very happy about the plans. &quot;It's right at
        the back of me,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe the plans hold
        significant implications for the village.&quot;&nbsp; Sid Whitmore,
        district councillor, said: &quot;I am up in arms about the whole
        thing.&quot;&nbsp; </font>H<font color="#000080">e feels particularly
        strongly about plans to build a village hall. He explained that the
        village already has an adequate hall and the applicants had not bothered
        to ask the parish council if they needed another.&nbsp; He said that the
        villagers had not been consulted over the plans either. &quot;I shall be
        most strongly opposing this on behalf of the villagers and my own
        feelings,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;It makes a nonsense of the
        structure plans,&quot; said Mr Whitmore.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Architect Richard Nelson of Gotch Saunders and
        Surridge is dealing with the application. He said he was simply working
        to his brief and declined to comment further.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The plan is set out on Courteenhall Farms
        Estate (ie. Hereward Wake's land) to a large extent (see map below) but also makes use
        of the field alongside the football fields and council allotments, which
        is owned by Vaughan.&nbsp; This proposal was roundly thrown out by
        councillors and planners but is regarded as a notable events as it is
        said <b>&quot;it paved the way for the group of affordable houses to be
        later established outside the village confines&quot;. </b>That <a href="../../affordable.htm">affordable
        houses project</a> was started in 2005 at the western end of the area
        involved.</font></p>
