        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">For
        quite a few years the study of Blisworth had yielded just three members of
        the Brafield family, namely a <b>John Brafield</b> recorded as paying a hearth tax in 1674 and <b>Charles Brafield</b> who was a tenant farmer
        in Blisworth Parish under the Duke of Grafton from about 1740 to 1778,
        according to the estate rent books, followed by his son <b>Edward
        Brafield,</b> when Charles died, until 1783 when Edward died.&nbsp; On maps
        published in 1727 it is clear that Charles held around 122 acres, second
        largest family holding only to the Plowmans with 220 acres.&nbsp; The
        Plowmans occupied what is now known as Blisworth House just to the south
        of the church and the Brafields occupied what was then Manor Farm, or
        the &quot;Manor&quot;, opposite the church and to the north on the High
        Street, a house with Tudoresque features that stood until 1896 when it
        was taken down as unsafe by the Burbidge family.&nbsp; The fact that the
        fine stone door heads were eventually merely discarded is recorded by
        our late historian George Freeston before WWII and again later as a relatively ordinary
        house in brick was being built there.&nbsp; It sounded like George had given
        them a good ticking off.&nbsp; <a href="../SpecOccasion01.htm">The inset picture shows</a> the house in
        c1890 while a village rally for the &quot;Benefit Club&quot; was going
        on.</span></font></p>
        <p>
        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A site very close to the Manor was
        identified, mistakenly, by the Ordnance Survey team in c1850 as the
        site of&nbsp; <a href="../Articles/Wakeseat.html">the Wake family seat</a>, until c1540, and a mark has appeared upon their maps from 1880
        to about 1970 proclaiming this ancient feature.&nbsp; However, the OS had
        confused this with the larger house - Blisworth House.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">From
        the details of the Crown Lands Purchases we learn that a <b>Charles
        Brayfield</b> was <a href="manor-summary.htm"> freeholder from 1649 to 1660</a> of what might be
        estimated to be 190 acres in Blisworth.&nbsp; This Charles Brayfield was
        likely to be a yeoman (equivalent to a Justice of the Peace) and influential.&nbsp;
        He may well have secured a mortgage in order to quickly respond to the
        sale terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, sixty seven years later
        another Charles, the one mentioned in the paragraph above, is recorded on a map as a
        tenant in 1727.&nbsp; Rent books claim a Charles as tenant from 1740,
        being the first of the surviving books.&nbsp; There are certainly at
        least two Charles's in the family from 1649 to 1783.&nbsp; This second
        Charles was also important in the village, being made a thirdborough (<a href="../Articles/Law_and_order.htm">assistant
        Constable</a>) in 1740.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">An impressive family tree,
        recorded in ancestry.co.uk files, has been kindly shown to me by
        Jan Royal, a descendant of the Brafields in Blisworth.&nbsp; Her tree
        shows a record that the second (the last) Charles as being born in 1694
        in Blisworth and dying in 1778.&nbsp; The farm was relinquished in 1783
        when his son <b>Edward</b> died.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The tree also claims a
        provisional record for a <b>William Brafield</b> who <u> died</u>,
        yeoman farmer, in Blisworth
        in 1621 and a <b>John Brafield</b> who died in 1647.&nbsp; The lifetimes
        of these two, if in Blisworth, would have seen virtually
        all the oldest cottages being significantly refurbished or freshly built
        whilst Blisworth was incorporated into the Honour of Grafton.&nbsp; It
        is thought that William originated from Hanslope.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">At the other end
        of the range of dates in Blisworth we can see that <b>John, Edward
        Trotter </b>and <b>Ann Brafield</b> were born in 1780, 1781 and 1782
        respectively, to Ann Howard (no data) and the above-mentioned Edward shortly before his death
        aged 45.&nbsp; These children being the grand-children of the last Charles.&nbsp; Interestingly
        the second boy was given the name Trotter, no doubt from the rector at
        the time who must have been a friend of the family - Rev. Nathaniel Trotter (Rector from 1762 -
        1797).&nbsp; These three children were the last of the Brafields to be
        born in Blisworth.&nbsp; Another interesting point is that Edward
        Trotter Brafield is recorded born at number 40 High Street, Blisworth.&nbsp;
        We must bear in mind that house numbers in Blisworth were almost never
        mentioned and were not organised until 1952, to help the
        postal services <a href="../Articles/post_office_services.htm"> when their base was moved to
        Northampton</a>.&nbsp; In Victorian times the post was collected from
        trains and sorted in a stone-built hut in the High Street so the post staff would
        know everybody and there was no need for house numbers - there being a
        clear indication of this in a <a href="../1936-list.htm">local directory
        dated 1936</a>.&nbsp; Anyway, in 1952 the site
        of Manor House, ie. the brick &quot;Manor&quot; house was numbered 46
        not 40, with C. F. Burbidge in residence.&nbsp; This coincidence is
        testament to a fair preservation in the number of doors in the High
        Street and an interesting early application of the convention to begin
        numbering at the &quot;Townsend&quot;, with even numbers on the
        right-hand side.&nbsp; Another surprise is that the street that goes right through
        the village was called High Street in 1781.&nbsp; In mid-19C, the lower half was
        called Bridge Street for a while - perhaps to help people locate the
        canal!</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">All three of these children
        of Edward's left Blisworth.&nbsp; John left when he married Mary Cooke - see
        below.&nbsp; Edward Trotter became a&nbsp; cabinet-maker and bedstead-maker
        in the Tottenham Court Road, London, recorded as such as early as in 1822 (Pigot's
        directory).&nbsp; His sister Ann married William George of Gayton in
        1804 and so also left Blisworth.&nbsp; She had no children and died in
        Roade in 1856 while her husband lived on for a while in Gayton.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">After the last births in
        Blisworth in the 1780s, nearly another twenty years go by before 7 children are
        born in Tiffield from 1801 - 1816 to <b> John Brafield</b> and Mary Cooke (m. at
        Whittlebury in 1801) - <b>John Cooke, Edward, William,
        Sarah, Thomas, Agnes </b>and<b> Mary Ann</b>.&nbsp; It appears that John Brafield decided to settle in
        Tiffield,
        where similar farms to those in the Grafton Estate could be rented from the Fermor family.&nbsp;
        Perhaps John Brafield could see the
        benefit in not having to endure <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#arm"> an industrial Blisworth</a>
        that surely ensued upon the arrival of the canal.&nbsp; It is thought that the great
        majority of Brafields in Northamptonshire came from this line.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The span from c1600 to 1800
        in which the Brafield family were resident in Blisworth covers a period
        of many political changes that impacted on rural life and, with the
        arrival of the canal in 1796, Blisworth saw the dawn of the industrial
        revolution in the form of transportation (rail and canal) and local
        quarrying and mining.</font>
