      Confines, March 2012:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been requested of the
      Parish Council that they write a stern letter to the <b>SNC</b> on the
      basis that opinions in the village from the 2010 Community Survey had
      indicated that further village enlargement was generally thought
      undesirable and that the village confines should not be extended at all in
      2012, being the year planned for a review.&nbsp; The vice-chairman heads a sub-group that
      normally deals with planning matters.&nbsp; This sub-group convened during
      February and decided that the original sternness was too confrontational
      and an alternative text be recommended for the <b>PC</b> to
      consider.&nbsp; This was reviewed at the <b>PC</b> meeting on March 5th.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <font color="#000080">In essence it was determined that the letter should stress
      the concern we have over village enlargement, making some of the points
      that were included in the stern draft, and request that the <b>PC</b>
      be involved with the <u> <b>SNC</b></u> in their review of the
      village confines.&nbsp; The letter was sent to the <b>SNC</b> on March
      30th.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 15"><font color="#000080">With
        the above deliberations stress was also laid on the fact that the <b>
      blisworth.org.uk</b> website is an independent one with no link what so
      ever with
      the <b>PC</b> - and this was also pointed out to the <b>SNC</b> in case
        they had already come across the original sternly worded text.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 35; padding-right: 15"><i><font color="#000080"></o:p></o:p></font></i><font color="#000080"></o:p></font><font color="#000080">
      The <b> SNC</b> is relaxed about their current land-bank situation as developments
      at Towcester and Brackley have completely removed pressure on villages
      until 2016.&nbsp; However, this will not always be the case and Blisworth
      should resist such 'preparatory expansions' as extending the confines.&nbsp;
      It is noteworthy that in proposal documents for the assignment of
      management regions within South Northamptonshire, the projected increase
      to 2017 for the number of the electorate in Blisworth parish is 90.&nbsp;
      This number is thought to equate to 53 houses, using a postulated average of 1.7
      voters per household (the number is based on the village's current
      population), whilst the numbers of houses known to have recently been built
      and are agreed to be built are 27 (Chapel Hill Farm) plus 6 (the Ladyfield
      units that may actually have been counted prior to this comparison) plus 5
      (distributed in-fill).&nbsp; This seems
      to suggest another 15 (may be 21) houses to be allocated somewhere in the village by
      2017 and that number would have to be outside the current confines.&nbsp;
      Perhaps the balance is small enough to be due to noise, on the other hand,
      perhaps planners
      already have at least a small field in mind for 2016/17 with more to come in
      successive years.</font></p>

        2, 2012</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A notification of the timetable for
        the <b>SNC</b> to review the village confines was given out.&nbsp; The
        formative period is May to October 2012, with a draft presentable within
        <b>SNC</b> by January 2013.&nbsp; As stated elsewhere, the
        new confines will follow clearly established boundaries to avoid
        confusing difficulties that have arisen in some villages.&nbsp; This
        inevitably means that whole fields (not part-fields) will be
        circumscribed.&nbsp; The confines are not
        expected to be formalised, with central government, until 2013/2014, the
        timing clearly tuned to <b>SNC</b>'s needs to plan their 5 year
        land-bank for 2015 onwards.</font></p>

          meeting that the &quot;housing needs survey&quot; mentioned last
          month, see below, should be carried out to help in&nbsp;<strong>PC</strong>'s
          consultation with the <b>SNC</b> on the Confines.&nbsp; It was
          realised&nbsp;that it should be configured to indicate any need for

          4, 2012</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been decided to wait for the <b>SNC</b>
          to issue their first consultation draft of the new village confines
          rather than approach them prescriptively. Emphasis was placed
          on the probability that the changes will only reflect anyway a
          tidying-up and removal of anomalies, although the <b>SNC</b>  had
          already remarked that the two areas marked with an <b>H </b>in the map below would
          receive support in principle if ever proposed for development.
          Patience for news from the <b>SNC</b> was dwindling by February 2013 -
          perhaps they would request an update. But the quiet period continues .

          2, 2013</b>&nbsp; The decision mentioned above has meant that, even
          now, nearly every month, <b>SNC</b> report back that an announcement
          on the new confines is deferred owing to &quot;broader organisation
          issues&quot;. The approval of a massive (1000 houses) development at
          Brackley has meant that pressure on villages such as ours, in terms of
          land-bank allocation, is significantly relieved for many years (but
          the ongoing Chapel Hill Farm project apparently helps - this being a
          point that they must declare?)</font>

          13, 2014</b>&nbsp; The <b>PC</b> met to finalise the wording of a
          draft that expressed response for Blisworth to the Local Plan. It was
          there recommended we retain confines as a useful attribute and in the
          next revision (2014 - 15) accept only minor adjustments plus the
          inclusion of the field adjacent to the playing fields (see 'H' at Sept
          2012) with a reference to its asset value for the future.</font>

      Neighbourhood Plan, February 2012:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eventual development by the <b>PC</b>
      of a
      Neighbourhood Plan (&quot;Neighbourhood Plan&quot; is the latest set of <a href="../New&#32;Houses/nhoodplans.htm">new
      goalposts</a> applying to communities invited to join in
      &quot;Localism&quot;) there could also be made the point that the village should not
      expand much in future.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan would be expected to go into
      detail on what would be acceptable types of housing, acceptable street and
      house design, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
      it is a fact that enthusiasm for embarking on a relatively expensive
      process of creating a neighbourhood plan has been much dampened by the
      realisation that the mere fact of having a plan does not facilitate any veto
      over development.&nbsp; Development remains a matter for government, both
      central and local, and having a plan simply helps ensure that the design
      of new houses, or new shops, indeed new anything, will have been thought
      out ahead of time.&nbsp; In
      view of the dates given in the paragraph immediately above this one, there
      can be no specific gain in completing a plan before about 2015/16 and this
      may have a beneficial effect on how the plan project is funded.&nbsp; So it remains to be seen whether or not our <b>PC</b>
      will embark on neighbourhood planning - they certainly have a small number of
      souls committed to the idea!</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 90; padding-right: 80"><font color="#000080"><b>April
        2, 2012</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The points covered in a neighbourhood plan will need to match those
        sections highlighted in the <b>NPPF</b>, a multi-100 page draft on a <u>National
        Planning and Policy Framework</u> that has been recently rolled out. It
        is the opinion of one villager, at least, that there is a serious need
        for a careful analysis of Blisworth's needs if a couple of new fields
        are included in the confines review.&nbsp; Not only housing but also
        roads, parking, shops and leisure facilities need to be considered from
        a standpoint of <u>Desirable Village Design</u>.&nbsp; Good design is one area where there
        should be a high probability that a substantial consensus will be achieved.&nbsp;
        A well-timed &quot;present-position statement&quot; from Blisworth, costing
        relatively little but nevertheless having the status of a brief
        neighbourhood plan, should be enough to cover our concerns and it is
        hoped that an opportunity to go that route can be explored.</font></p>

        15, 2012</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent discussions with the <b>SNC</b>
        planners, it has been suggested that the <b>PC</b> might go through
        &quot;Blisworth's housing needs&quot; in some detail (large houses,
        small downsize houses and affordable houses, etc).&nbsp; This could be
        the kernel of a &quot;present-position statement&quot;.</font></p>

        4, 2012</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; After much deliberation the survey mentioned in
        May has been shelved. The whole topic of neighbourhood plans has
        withered in the Summer sun, there being no-one who is keen enough to
        promote it. By February 2013 an opportunity was taken to remind the
        parish council that they still had not indicated to <b>SNC</b> what
        would amount to a 'suitable' array for new housing in the village.</font></p>

        consideration regarding the current Local Plan. This appears to satisfy
        at minimal cost the requirements previously couched as &quot;Neighbourhood
        Plan&quot;, &quot;Village Design&quot;, etc.</font></p>
