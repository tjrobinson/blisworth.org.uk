        <p>Area of study for the <a href="http://www.olioweb.me.uk/clasp/CLASP/htmlpages/more_clasp.html"> CLASP group</a> is a triangle formed with its
        corners at (i). Whilton/Norton&nbsp;
        (ii). Duston&nbsp; and (iii). Towcester.&nbsp; The roads defining the
        sides of the triangle are, the Watling Street, the &quot;Nobottle Road&quot;
        and a track identified in more recent than Roman times as The Kingsway
        from Towcester &quot;north bridge&quot; through Tiffield and Gayton
        Wilds, through the west-back of Gayton and via straight sections to
        Kislingbury, over the Nene Bridge at Kislingbury and thence joining the
        Nobottle Road.</p>
        <p>There was probably another road, near parallel with the last named, from Towcester
        that links up the Hunsbury settlement, branching at a point just north
        of Tiffield and passing by the temple/villa that was situated at the
        highest point on Gayton Hill.&nbsp; There are other significant Roman roads too numerous
        to mention here.</p>
        <p>Blisworth parish is near, but outside, the south-east part of this
        triangle.&nbsp; Thanks to metal-detectorists working on Wakelin's land, two
        settlement sites have been found in Tiffield parish, one<a href="../Archeology/gayton_dig.htm"> farmstead site
        in Gayton parish</a> and one maybe interesting site at Blisworth near to
        what <a href="../RQuarry/roman-farm.htm"> was Glebe Farm</a>.&nbsp; The latter is possibly confused by quarrying
        disturbances.&nbsp; Earlier sites found at Blisworth is one, found in
        1866, beside the main 19th century limestone quarry (now filled with
        refuse backfill and covered) and one, found in
        1841, very near the Gayton parish boundary that is now obliterated by
        the A43 bypass works.&nbsp; It is thought there must have been more
        settlements and it is conceded
        that somewhere in the village itself there must be at least one
        settlement site, the ironstone bluff area being a distinct
        possibility.&nbsp; Another settlement that may turn out to be
        significant is that near Nunn Wood in Easton Neston parish.&nbsp; Note
        the overview article on the website: <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/romanfinds.htm">Roman Finds</a>.</p>
        <p>
        A major site is <a href="http://www.whitehallvilla.co.uk/"> Whitehall</a> near Nether
        Heyford from which much local knowledge has accumulated to CLASP.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The intention is to eventually cover 30 parishes with the expectation
        of working nearly 500 settlement sites.&nbsp; Perhaps we should be
        patient for it may be years before CLASP groups, consisting only of
        volunteers and unpaid specialists, could be mustered in Blisworth
        parish, which has the unfortunate feature of many fields radically
        disturbed
        for ironstone.</p>
        <p>So far the general
        conclusions are as follows, for all sites that have yielded data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1.&nbsp; a site is occupied continuously from 50AD to 350AD (numbers
        display spurious precision but refer to centuries) and this is shown by
        coin losses and by pottery sherds.</p>
        <p>2.&nbsp; early occupation indicates modest settlements, using
        pre-Roman building design, but by 200AD there are established sites with larger houses, clearly of Roman style, with 50 to 150
        rooms.&nbsp; A settlement would be defined by a perimeter earth bank
        (topped by wattles?) and within the enclosure there can be discerned
        paddocks and stock management folds.&nbsp; There is sometimes evidence
        of the obliteration of earlier boundaries to modest field.&nbsp; The population there probably
        consisted of one or two extended families working together.&nbsp; There
        is no DNA from grave remains yet but one suspects that inward investment,
        from Europe, may have triggered the change.&nbsp; By 300 - 400AD there are signs that
        the settlement may have become run down and relatively disused.&nbsp;
        This change is indicated through the lifetime, demolition and
        replacement of buildings.</p>
        <p>3.&nbsp; Heavy clay land and intermediate land carry typical density
        of settlements (1 in each 2 sq. km.) whilst gravel-based land carries a
        greater number by nearly a factor of two.&nbsp; A farmer would supply
        the reason for this - gravel based land is ideal for stock such as a mix
        of oxen and sheep while other land would suit best beet and corn crops.&nbsp; All land types were used
        for establishing a discernable settlement (ie. buildings) except for
        alluvial land where there was a danger of flooding.&nbsp; Presumably the
        value of pseudo-watermeadow land would have been appreciated by the
        Romans but there
        would be no remaining evidence of their use of them owing to flooding.</p>
        <p>4.&nbsp; Pottery and glass was imported from an amazingly wide base
        from 200AD onwards.&nbsp; On a site one can discern 20 or 30 different
        types of pottery (that covers a usage span of 250 years) and this points
        to the effective distribution of many small suppliers.&nbsp; Glass that
        is cloudy yet fabricated by either flat spinning or cutting a blown
        cylinder was imported for houses in the mid-Roman period, evidently a
        rarity and so assumed very expensive.</p>
        <p>5.&nbsp; In some places there is evidence of Roman-like occupation of
        sites through to 550AD using architecture not dissimilar to Roman.&nbsp;
        These people eventual could call themselves English!&nbsp; Saxon
        settlements are recognised from 650AD onwards and it is notable that
        some Romanesque aspects of their architecture, eg. Blixworth Saxon
        Church, can be recognised.</p>
