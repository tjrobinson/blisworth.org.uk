      <td width="481" height="737"><b>The Story</b>&nbsp; This account is going
        to be light on archeological facts because we are waiting for the
        reports back from the expert and the organiser of the dig - Stephen
        Young - who is a lecturer at the Nene College.&nbsp; More may be added
        later.
        <p>Neither Blisworth nor Gayton has much Roman history.&nbsp; Pottery
        has been found in the 1950s and 60s near <a href="../loundes.htm">The
        Loundes</a> on both sides of the <a href="../Rails.htm#smj"> SMJ disused railway</a> line.&nbsp; The
        remains of a Roman villa or temple was found in 1842 at a site now
        obliterated by the A43 Blisworth bypass and a number of interesting
        artifacts have been discovered on the hill between Gayton and Blisworth
        mainly by people with metal detectors although simple field walking by
        people with good eyes have resulted in much pottery shards being
        discovered.&nbsp; In the book, now out of print, <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#romans">reproduced
        on this website</a> a case is made for a track between the centre of
        Blisworth and the area near the 1842 villa at which there was found a
        corn-drier during <a href="../At-GaytonRd.htm#corndrier">preparation for
        the bypass</a>.&nbsp; This case was purely based on maps and crop
        markings.</p>
        <p>In October 2009, the whole of the Monumental Record has now been <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/romanfinds.htm">mapped
        and available</a> on this website. The above paragraph is a little light
        on detail!</p>
        <p>For years, members of a <a href="archeo-blisworth.htm">metal detector
        operators club</a> have examined fields under the care of farmer Colin
        Wakelin and this story began in 2006 when a large amount of pottery
        shards and broken stone were found at the site marked as a yellow square
        in the map above.&nbsp; Later that year a field walking group was assembled
        so that the area could be assessed statistically.&nbsp; Pieces of
        walling stone, roof tiles and pottery was found but neither valuable
        items nor tessella pieces (as used in mosaics) were found which
        suggested a lowly farmstead may be located there.&nbsp; The window of
        opportunity, 29th and 30th August 2007, came between the stripping of
        the field of a previous crop and the seedbed preparation for the
        next.&nbsp; A magnetometer survey had been done of the area a few days
        before so Clive Wakelin, the farmer's son, was called upon to draw out a selection of
        trenches to a depth of about 60 cm. as guided by the suggestive alignments
        on the magnetometer mapping.&nbsp; The mapping showed two boundary lines
        for an enclosure and some more subtle lines indicating the edges of field
        divisions which could be Roman or iron age.</p>
        <p>Each trench was tidied most carefully to achieve near vertical sides,
        parallel edges and smooth horizontal bases. This was so that, in
        photographing the trenches and any feature therein, an accurate 3D
        impression may be gained from the view.&nbsp; The tidying process must
        be done with patience using a trowel and brush so that for any artifacts
        that are
        discovered their position may be recorded and analysed before lifting them out.&nbsp; In
        the one trench where there is a picture of workers on the left, there was soon
        revealed what initially seemed to be a stone wall.&nbsp; However the
        stones are placed together too loosely and in fact this feature, which
        coincides with one of the enclosure boundaries, has no definite explanation at
        present.&nbsp; Stones placed in a trench close to a boundary suggests a
        measure had been taken to prevent whatever animals were enclosed from digging their way
        out.&nbsp; Perhaps this field was a Roman warren?&nbsp; A more mundane
        explanation is that the structure was a drain - as indicated by water
        collecting at the base when the stones were removed.</p>
        <p>Nothing was found
        to revise the earlier impression that the site was of a modest Roman
        farmstead with a dating roughly indicated of 100 - 300 AD though a
        settlement could well have been there in Iron Age times.&nbsp; One
        highlight was the discovery of both the bottom and the top of a Roman
        glass perfume bottle found by Jim Aveling.&nbsp; The current view of Roman occupation of the Midlands is that there
        is at least some farmstead at every kilometer interval over grounds of
        all types; clay, gravel and loam.&nbsp; A bit of bone was found in one
        trench and this warrants further analysis.&nbsp; At the end of the
        second day the farmer returned to fill in the trenches and harrow the
        whole field for the next crop.&nbsp; People from the village enjoyed the
        two days and appreciated the enormous patience that archeologists must
        have to deal with any site in a disciplined way - so as not to mess up
        alignments of objects as they are discovered.&nbsp; Over a dozen people
        were involved in either the earlier field-walking or in this dig, at
        least part time.&nbsp; Maybe the next dig
        will be more rewarding - there is another promising site but its
        location is not being disclosed yet.</p>
        <p>Some catalogue of finds and an account of the site is hoped for from
        the archeologist.&nbsp; When that is received this preliminary account
        will be updated or a link will be provided here to the account, which
        will probably be posted on the <a href="http://www.claspweb.org.uk/">CLASP
        webpage</a>.&nbsp; Their August 2007 report is out and posted on that
        site.&nbsp; Page 15 gives the briefest mention of this dig but a later
        compilation by Clasp states:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Initial analysis of the pottery from the
        this site indicated that the settlement was particularly active during the late 1st to early 2nd century with 61% of the diagnostically datable pottery identified as belonging to this period. A significant amount of material from the assemblage indicated that the settlement flourished into the 2nd and early 3rd centuries. However it is interesting to note that the diagnostically datable material for this middle Roman period is only 36% of the total assemblage and approximately 50% of that available in the early period. In the late Roman period of the mid 3rd to 4th centuries AD associated pottery accounts for only 2% of the remaining sherds. The potential archaeological development here is that site pottery profiles related to settlements near Lactodurum (Towcester) are different
        compared to settlements associated with the Bannaventa (Whilton Locks) area.
        This chronological accent is indicative of </i><b>an early Roman focus</b><i> as opposed to the era of,
        in general, most 'Romanisation' during the late 2nd to early 3rd centuries AD. Should this result prove to be the 'norm' for the site profiles around Towcester, then we can start to see that the 'imperial experience' here is going to be substantially different from that around
        Bannaventa.</i></p>
        <p>This is what it's like - with every new site, archaeologists can
        gradually piece together a coherent story - and three years on dr. S.
        Young gave a fascinating <a href="../Development/romanstory.htm">talk in
        Blisworth on current conclusions</a>.</p>
