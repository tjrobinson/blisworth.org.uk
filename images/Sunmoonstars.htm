        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40">This is <a href="Bridges-history.htm"> an extract from
        Taylor's notes made in 1718</a> in preparation for the Bridges County
        History. A transcription of he full document which applies to Blisworth is available by
        <a href="M300.pdf">
        clicking here</a>.&nbsp; Taylor is answering a number of set questions as he
        visits the parishes of Northamptonshire.&nbsp; This is the question
        about any &quot;hambletts or innshipps&quot; (spelt variously).&nbsp;
        For Blisworth he has no comment about the former - ie. there are no
        hamlets (The Arm was formed about 100 years later).&nbsp; He states
        there is one innship yet we would supposed at least two; The Royal Oak
        (probably with its former name <a href="Listed/ListedBldgs.htm#theoak">The
        Plough Alehouse</a> as mentioned in Grafton records) and The Sun, Moon
        and Stars recorded as &quot;The Chequers&quot;.&nbsp; He states the one as
        follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; S W clo is the Woodhouse &amp; belongs to Mr.
        Pickering of Bugbrook.&nbsp; A visit to the Bodleian Library is necessary
        to elucidate what the copyist has missed with the camera but the
        archivists at NRO suspect what is being recorded there is
        &quot;south-west close by&quot; and so it must refer to the Sun, Moon
        and Stars in an earlier incarnation.&nbsp; The oldest Grafton entry
        refers to it being called <a href="Listed/ListedBldgs.htm#sunms">The
        Chequers Ale House</a> around 1740 and that it was in a very poor state.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40">A working theory for the
        pubs timeline of Blisworth is therefore as follows:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40; padding-right: 40; padding-bottom: 20"><b>1718</b>
        - just the one, <b> The Woodhouse</b> (the property or just the trade owned by
        Mr. Pickering of Bugbrooke).&nbsp; Probably a three storey building
        built entirely of stone, having <a href="1727-map.htm">a long ridged
        roof parallel to the road, one chimney</a>.<br>
        c<b>1745</b> - the above has fallen into disrepair being called by then <b>
        The Chequers</b>, with Mrs. Cath Morris in trouble (<a href="Listed/ListedBldgs.htm#sunms">see
        records</a>), and another pub has been newly established or re-established, namely
        <b> The Plough</b>, at the Cross.<br>
        <b>1797</b> - Thomas Smith sells the above as a freehold property to John Linnett and
        he rebuilds it and sets it up as <b> The Half Moon</b>, adding a date
        plaque.&nbsp; The Plough by then had been
        renamed <b> The Royal Oak</b> and a new house is built near The Half Moon called
        <b>
        The Duke's Arms</b> (later called The Grafton Arms Inn).&nbsp; Obviously the
        inn and meals and ale trade was building up magnificently once the canal
        had arrived at Blisworth.<br>
        <b>1840</b>s - The name of the The Half Moon gradually changes to <b> The
        Sun, Moon and Stars</b>, we think, for the reason stated below.&nbsp; It
        was delicensed in the early 1960s so that the village was reliant once
        again on just one pub.

        and a guy from Phipps NBC wrote to the website to explain: 
        <p align="left">&nbsp; &quot;The sign dates to the early and mid 1950s.
        The Phipps company merged with NBC in 1957 and started re-branding their
        pubs using the composite name, Phipps NBC and logo from that date.&nbsp;
        Watney Mann took over in 1960 and from 1964 onwards the name was
        rationalised back to Phipps Brewery Ltd. Pub signs from this period were
        branded &quot;A Phipps house&quot; but the&nbsp; distinctive Watney
        typeface was used. The thin serifed typeface your sign displays was a
        post war style. Hope this solves a minor mystery&quot; - Mr. Neville,
        Phipps NBC. </td>

        possible that the council worked from an &quot;Award Map&quot; c. 1812

        Oddfellows c. 1946.

        <p>As explained elsewhere, the society was a benefits club but one which
        set out in Victorian times (c. 1842) with a very strict code expected of
        members.&nbsp; There was a &quot;Book of Fines&quot; which seems to be
        lost but notes from it suggest a fine of 6d (about 5% of weekly income)
        for none attendance to meetings, others for not addressing the meeting
        when leaving.&nbsp; Meetings were originally held with a strict etiquet
        for clothing and ritual - akin to a masonic meeting.</p>
        <p>The chief purpose of the society became to make collections for a
        fund which may be dispensed as sick pay for workers who had piece-time
        employment, ie. most workers in the village.&nbsp; With the coming of
        state pensions, legislation for workers' protection and the National
        Health Service, the society instead offered an investment and savings
        fund.</td>

        <p><b>31-10</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The society began in the rooms at the Sun,
        Moon and Stars but was moved to a room at the Royal Oak.&nbsp; On a wall
        there, probably in what became known as &quot;The Club Room&quot; - now
        the skittles room, was hung this panel with a hinged cover.&nbsp; The
        panel lists the masters of this branch of the order up to the final year before the Blisworth group was <a href="Sun-Moon&#32;and&#32;Stars/closure.jpg"> disbanded in
        1974</a> - after
        over 100 years.&nbsp; It is thought that the order did not have its own
        Grand master for a few years as W. Mansfield joined in 1841 uninitiated.</p>
        <p>Actually the landlord at the Royal Oak gave the group notice to quit
        using the room in 1956 and from then on they met in the Baptists Lecture
        Hall.</p>

      <td width="349" height="510"><b><a name="templars"></a>31-11</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; There were at least
        two other orders/clubs with a similar aim to that of the Oddfellows.&nbsp;
        This is Henry Plowman (died 1916) who was the &quot;master&quot; of the order of
        &quot;Good Templars No. 3353&quot; in Blisworth.&nbsp; The order
        probably faded out c. 1900 because nothing more could be found out about
        it by GF in 1953 other than it too was a strict order but based upon
        Baptists members.&nbsp; Baptist records first mention the Templars in
        1879.&nbsp; Junior members learnt discipline and debating
        skills, meeting in the Baptists Lecture Hall.&nbsp; The club was
        strictly teetotal, unlike the Oddfellows, and it bore the full title
        of&nbsp; &quot;The Independent Order of Good Templars&quot;.&nbsp;
        Presumably because people who were only very junior members could be
        reached by 1953, the one remaining memory was that there was an acronym
        IOGT which youngsters converted to &quot;I O Granny Tuppence&quot;.
        <p>Contemporaneously with this order was the &quot;Blisworth Benefits
        Club&quot; which aimed to provide assistance for poor families esp. the
        unemployed.&nbsp; <a href="SpecOccasion01.htm">Image number 23-01</a> in the occasions section is an
        early picture of one of their parades. </td>
