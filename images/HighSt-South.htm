HIGH STREET - South side</font></b></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Apart from a picture of the blacksmith's at Stoneacres there are<br>
not many pictures of the south side of the High Street.&nbsp; The first<br>
shows the roof of Crieff House in the distance with the diminutive<br>
cottage, known as the <a href="cobblers.htm"> Old Boot Shop</a>, in front -
demolished in<br>
around 1965.&nbsp; The high end-on gable has been severely modified<br>
in the 1980's as the wall was threatening to fall into the street.&nbsp; It<br>
is now known as Tudor Cottage.&nbsp; The second picture is of the<br>
front door, two doors towards the Elm Tree from Tudor Cottage,<br>
being the house with the well-known, but not well-remembered<br>
at night, steps which nearly spanned the whole pavement.&nbsp; The<br>
parish council eventually got the steps modified to be more safe.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">The gentleman in both pictures is Charles George Hillyard <br>
(1878 - 1970), nicknamed &quot;Wag&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; His brother-in-law, Aubrey<br>
Sturdgess, ran a dental practice from the house.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080">Charles Hillyard was keen on football in his day.&nbsp;
So was his son<br>
<a href="Footer.htm#freddie">Freddie Hillyard</a> who is pictured on this
website sporting a pair of<br>
personal trophies.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><img border="0" src="Personalities/Hillyard01.jpg" width="333" height="460"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Both pictures are by Walter Alexander (a contemporary<br>
of Charles Hillyard) who entitled his second picture - <br>
&quot;Where there's a Will, there's a Way&quot; - it won a national<br>
photographic competition.&nbsp; Wag lived here with his wife<br>
Daisy (ne Sturdgess).</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="High-Street/1908&#32;view&#32;east.jpg" width="500" height="500"><br>
<font color="#000080">This charming picture is from a 1908 postcard.&nbsp; Taken
from near Crieff House, it<br>
shows the street to the east.&nbsp; The cobbler's shop is lost in a 'hollow' to
the right but<br>
the building shown before with its protruding steps is visible, as is the
blacksmith's<br>
shed and his house beyond (Stoneacre).</font></p>
