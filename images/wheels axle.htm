        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 10; padding-right: 5">In around 2003 a pair of wheels on their axle were
        recovered from the Stoke Road allotment field.&nbsp; They were clearly the remains
        of a wagon used in the <a href="Ironston-part1.htm">mining period for
        ironstone</a>, 1860 to 1910.</p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 10; padding-right: 5">The Canal
        Partnership has been storing the wheel-set in one of their lockups and it has been possible recently to take some photographs.&nbsp;
        It has been suggested that the wheel-set
        should form the basis
        of a reconstructed wagon which could be placed appropriately
        to commemorate some of the village's history.</p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 10; padding-right: 5">The first picture shows the wheel-set in its present
        condition.&nbsp; The wheels are 20&quot; in diameter and the
        gauge,&nbsp; ie. separation between rails, is 45&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; These proportions match
        very
        closely those in the second picture which was taken by Walter Alexander in roughly
        1920.&nbsp; This picture shows a
        group of wagons in the curved cutting, commonly called &quot;The
        Tip&quot;, that incises the allotment field.</p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 10; padding-right: 5">The wheel-set in storage is somewhat &quot;beaten
        up&quot; but would look fine once it has been sand-blasted.&nbsp;
        The wheels seem to be rusted solidly onto the axle.&nbsp; Note that the
        picture of the drum, image <b><a href="Ironstonebr.htm#drum">17-05</a></b>,
        shows a discarded wheel similar to the above.</p>
        <p align="left" style="padding-left: 10; padding-right: 5">The Blisworth
        Heritage Society have assumed responsibility for the future of the
        wheels and have on at least one occasion reported to the Parish Council
        their suggestions for the relic. Various places close to the run of the
        railway that once accommodated the source wagon have arisen, with
        villagers inputting suggestions. In many cases the BHS has kept their
        cards close on this topic whilst their latest suggestion, <b>February 2015</b>,
        is that the relic be the
        basis of a village bench and that it might be placed near the Sun, Moon and
        Stars building. This does have the merit of adding some interest to a
        rather dull and run down part of the village whilst perhaps promoting a modest
        information board that merely states where and when the relic was
        rediscovered and alluding to the mining background of the village for a
        time. It is unfortunate, however, that the BHS has been reluctant to
        locate the relic in a place that is historically appropriate in favour
        of inducing visitors interest in the village from a location in the
        &quot;church and canal&quot; centre of the village.</p>
