Centrefold Map</font></b></p>

<p align="center" style="padding-right: 60"><font size="3">A recent article on <a href="../Development/early-story.htm">Feudal
Blisworth</a> has been added to the website.</font></p>

<p style="padding-right: 60">The image shown below is the same as used in the centre of the
<a href="BBook.html">Blisworth Book, 2004</a>, with the addition of the label
for 'Saltway' running across the southern part of the parish.&nbsp; A
description of the <a href="../Articles/Roman-Salt-Way.html">Roman Saltway</a>
can be found on this website.&nbsp; The map could be updated to show what I now
believe to be <a href="../Fisher/Fishweir.htm">a large fish pool</a> that was
probably in use up to about 1700 just south of the Green.</p>

<p style="padding-right: 60">The map is a hotch-potch of features from various
dates (eg. <a href="../Development/SouthVillage.jpg">see 1727 map</a>) and therefore should be used with care.&nbsp; Perhaps of help to those familiar with the village,
the canal and the 'cut' and tunnel mouth are ghosted in to show their position
in relation to other features, particularly the Green which was destroyed in the
process of building the canal.&nbsp; The main line of the railway is completely omitted.&nbsp;
In error, the minor road joining Mill Lane to the road to Gayton was
omitted.&nbsp; The inclusion of height markers in metres state the surveyed
altitude of the stream above sea-level.&nbsp; The position of the Stoke Road
(which began <a href="../Tunnel&#32;Toll/tunneltoll.htm">as a toll road</a>) is
ghosted in to show its position in relation to the various medieval green lanes.</p>

<p style="padding-right: 60">The location of the Manor opposite the church is
now thought to be quite wrong.&nbsp; <a href="../Articles/Wakeseat.html">Wake's
seat</a> was more probably located near the Hall.</p>
