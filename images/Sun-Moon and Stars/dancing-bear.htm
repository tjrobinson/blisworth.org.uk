<p align="center"><b>&quot;The Dancing Bear&quot; - recalled by Fred Burbidge
for George Freeston in the 1950s.</b></p>
<p>I remember the dancing bear which came annually to the village. The fellow
would call round in the morning, door to door - the bear had a collar with an 8
foot pole on it and it stood 7 foot high. It was black with a beautiful coat
that shone like silk - and you could stroke it.&nbsp; It had shining yellow
eyes.&nbsp; Everyone would put something it the cap - perhaps they wanted him to
go away! The fellow collected a lot of money and at night put the bear in the stable
at the <a href="../Sunmoonstars.htm"> Sun, Moon and Stars</a> and he put it there many times over the years but one
time he forgot to give it a drink before he put it into bed. At one in the
morning it woke the landlord, it ripped the hayrack down and had broken the
stalls.&nbsp; It was knocking on the
door with a piece of wood. The landlord came down and woke the man up, who was
asleep in the 'Big Room' where the bear did his dance, and said &quot;your bear
is smashing the place up&quot;. &quot;Oh dear&quot;, he said, &quot;Get me a
bucket of water quick and put a pint of beer in it and give it to the
bear&quot;. &quot;You do it!&quot;. So he did and the bear drank it like a child
and became as quiet as a child. The landlord valued the custom and said that
Phipp's would pay for the repairs to the stable so the bear-man had to pay
nothing at all. He went away rejoicing and on to Towcester in the morning.
Often, when there wasn't the bear there was a monkey with a barrel organ. The
monkey would hop around collecting the money - Italians they were, I think.
Anyway, the best show was still the dancing bear in the Big Room with the fellow
playing his mouth-organ, playing it to perfection. I think the Big Room was used as
a dormitory in the old times for canal workers.</p>
<p>[Note: A long lost street of Northampton, now under the Mayorhold car park, Bearward Street (<font SIZE="3"><i>Berewardstrete
</i>1281)</font>, was so named after<font SIZE="3"> the 'bear ward' or 'keeper
of performing bears,' a common sight in the Middle Ages.&nbsp; Something that
Fred Burbidge recalls from c. 1900 in fact goes back at least 600 years]</font></p>
