        have Dan Weinbren's new book &quot;The Oddfellows 1810 - 2010&quot;
        published in the Spring of 2010 to thank for new light shed on this
        topic.&nbsp; Dan Weinbren has kindly presented us with a complimentary
        copy of the book which will be held by the Blisworth Heritage Society.</span></font></p>

        <font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        Oddfellow members modelled themselves on freemasons though were
        dedicated more to people of modest lifestyle, labourers and artisans,
        rather than the oft-thought of association with business and the middle
        class.&nbsp;
        Symbolism came into the style and the &quot;All-seeing Eye&quot; was
        adopted very early on to represent the overseer duty of all members,
        individually and collectively, to look after all members in terms of welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font>
        </p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The sun, moon and stars, known in Scripture as
        the host of heaven, are found to the fore in Masonic imagery (see <a href="http://www.secretsofmasons.com/masonic-symbols.htm">http://www.secretsofmasons.com/masonic-symbols.htm</a>
        from which the imagery in the inset photo was obtained)
        and have been relevant symbols in Baal worship, in the occult and,
        perhaps with less thought behind them, in various &quot;new age&quot;
        shops.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">For the Oddfellows the &quot;sun, moon and
        stars&quot; collectively might represent all God's creation, all that is wonderful and admirable.&nbsp;
        Individually the sun and moon would represent opposites and to bring
        them together in a ceremony would avow to desire a unity within society,
        co-operation and harmony.&nbsp; The stars, in particular the <i> seven</i> stars
        (and the inn was indeed once named with the seven), recalls The
        Plaides constellation representing the &quot;seven liberal
        arts&quot;.&nbsp; Including this seven stars symbol avows to strive to a better
        education, bearing in mind that many members of the Oddfellows were of
        modest background.&nbsp; The seven liberal arts, as defined classically,
        are Poetry, Thinking carefully and logically, Speaking clearly and/or persuasively, Arithmetic,
        Geometry, Music and Astronomy.&nbsp; For a labourer, the last four would
        translate perhaps to Numeracy and an appreciation of Art.&nbsp; These
        educational targets have cropped up frequently, for example: Pius XII said (September 5, 1957):
        <i> "A liberal arts education remains unequalled for the exercise and development of the most valuable qualities of the mind: penetration of thought, broadmindedness, fineness of analysis, gifts of
        expression.&nbsp; Not all students will be able to reach all
        seven.&nbsp; Maybe not even all our teachers . . . the approach to every
        new subject should be, however, an open door.&quot;</i></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The Oddfellows also was a&nbsp;<span class="413141408-20052010">friendly
        society, that is a form of </span>mutual insurance association that was
        far more financially robust than the church and Duke of Grafton's
        charities on account of nationwide subscriptions.&nbsp; Men subscribed a
        small sum each month into a common pot, often at a ‘lodge’ meeting
        in a pub. Members could expect payments from the common funds in the
        event of illness or death. There were social and ritual elements to
        meetings, referred to above as 'ceremony', and these would have
        reinforced the sense of occasion and importance.&nbsp; Through ceremony
        the</font><font color="#000080"> Oddfellows avowed to betterment both in
        themselves as individuals and in how they volunteer to help neighbours.
        Imagery common to Oddfellows and to Freemasonry can be found in
        Weinbren's book on pages 219 and 221 and in frequent internet references,
        particularly to Freemasonry.&nbsp; The Half Moon Inn was registered as a lodge for
        the Oddfellows in 1842.&nbsp; We have just one reference&nbsp; that the &quot;host of heaven&quot; naming for the inn
        occurred briefly in 1822 but was not adopted generally (Mr. Rivett,
        c1966, referring to the conveyancing to P. Phipps - deeds have not
        been re-checked yet).&nbsp; If this were true it would suggest
        that a band of village men met there around that time and had formed at
        least a pseudo-Masonic group which must have found best expression later
        in terms of Oddfellowship, in 1842.&nbsp; From then on there would be
        suppertime conversations in which the wife might say, for example:
        &quot;you'll do the ... if there's time after all the 'sun moon and
        stars' has finished?&quot; to which the reply might be: &quot;Na, it's
        sun moon and stars on Wednesdays not Thursdays - it's Royal Oak
        tonight!&quot; - hence the name change.&nbsp; Records for the
        Wellingborough Lodge indicate that in 1930s it was moved that ritual and
        ceremony would be dropped as its continuance was having an adverse
        effect on the numbers wishing to join.&nbsp; Please refer to the <a href="Records/OF-Records.htm">article
        dealing with membership statistics</a> and founder members for a little
        more on the early years.</font>

        by the Blisworth Historical Buildings Trust which was formed, 2007 to
        2010, to promote a community use for the inn building.&nbsp; The
        building had been
        compulsorily purchased by the South Northamptonshire Council but will apparently
        be disposed of on the open market as the council
        experienced difficulties in achieving a viable plan for its
        restoration.&nbsp; However, the Oddfellows heritage of the building
        should not be lost to posterity and it is hoped that the logo, with the
        encircling words changed to recall the 1842 registration of the inn, be re-created in
        durably-enamelled
        stainless steel and affixed to
        the front of the building.</font>
