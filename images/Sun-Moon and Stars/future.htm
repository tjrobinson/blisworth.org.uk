OF THE SUN, MOON &amp; STARS BUILDING, BLISWORTH</font></b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="3">FIRST
OF ALL, A SOUTH NORTHANTS COUNCIL REPORT ON DEVELOPMENTS<br>
SINCE 1980 AND AN&nbsp; ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PRESENT POSITION, Nov 7th, 2006</font></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><b><font size="4">Proposed
Compulsory Purchase Order of the listed<br>
<a href="../Sunmoonstars.htm">
Sun, Moon &amp; Stars building</a> in Blisworth</font></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">South Northamptonshire Council
has finally been given formal permission from the Secretary of State for the
compulsory purchase of the listed Sun, Moon and Stars building in Blisworth
following the public inquiry held earlier this year.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">Plans to save the Grade 2 Listed
Building have been underway for many years after a lorry crashed into part of
the building in the 1980s.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">The owner was served with Repair
Notices when 'reasonable steps were not being taken to properly preserve the
building'. When these failed, the council drafted a compulsory purchase order to
save the building.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">Now, with confirmation of the
Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO), the council can work with the owner to agree a
price before starting work to repair the building and get it back into use.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">Councillor John Townsend, Cabinet
Member for safeguarding rural communities said, &quot;We are very pleased that
this long running project has finally been given the formal go-ahead from
government. Listed buildings form an important part of the character of our
rural communities and the Sun, Moon and Stars was such an integral part of the
village that the Council felt it was very important to protect it.&quot;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">The owner's objection to the CPO
in 2004 led to a public inquiry in July 2006, which concluded that reasonable
steps had not been taken to properly preserve the listed building.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">The Secretary of State was
satisfied that it was necessary to compulsory purchase the building to make sure
it would be preserved.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="3">ON-GOING
REPORTING OF THE NEWS:</font></b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">Blisworth now awaits the outcome
of talks between the Council and the owner.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">A Blisworth-based committee was
formed in early October 2006 to explore and promote the possibility of making
use of a part of this building as a key part of a Community Project.&nbsp; This
committee will next prepare a business plan at least partly based upon 'lottery
funding' to submit to the Council.&nbsp; The project title is the Sun, Moon and
Stars Community Project.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="3">UPDATE:
June 5th, 2007</font></b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">There has been a bit of a
row!&nbsp; Confusion has been created lately because of two unfortunate
errors.&nbsp; (1) the Blisworth Heritage Society (BHS) has been associated with,
and even made to appear responsible for, the promotional activities of the
community project committee.&nbsp; It is evident that this linking was not intended.&nbsp;
It was, in
fact, made clear at the outset by the BHS that they would not be involved in the
project.&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) the
promotional activities at Blisworth have been linked to 'interests' at Stoke
Bruerne.&nbsp; Maybe this was a pure accident but there is absolutely <b>NO</b>
&quot;Stoke Bruerne - Blisworth Partnership&quot;.&nbsp; Any interests at Stoke
Bruerne in the eventual commercialisation of Blisworth are merely informal.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">It is not clear whether or not the
community project committee will issue clarifying statements on these two points.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">Meanwhile, the lobbying for
support and funds continues by the efforts of the community project committee
and further progress on this will be reported below.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130"><b>For the record, this website
has no linking with the Sun, Moon &amp; Stars Community Project and has no formal linking
either with the Blisworth Heritage Society.</b>&nbsp; There are however, obvious
common threads between the objectives of both groups and the aims of this site.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="3">UPDATE:
June 9th, 2007</font></b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">On June 6th the CPO was
successfully served on the owner.&nbsp; Consequently, the building is now in the
hands of the South Northamptonshire Council who continue negotiations with the
former owner.&nbsp; The committee directing the
community project (SMS Steering Group) are continuing their work in securing a
part of the building for community use, ie. coffee shop/bistro/visitor centre/museum.&nbsp;
Quotes from the SNC bulletin are as follows, &quot;<font size="3"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US">Geo.
Freeston was well known locally and there is a lot of support to see his
collection properly archived and available to a wider audience.&quot;&nbsp;
There will be</span> &quot;conducted a feasibility study to look at possible
uses for the building, and funding sources - findings to be presented to the
Council before the end of the year.&quot;</font><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">It is the intention of the SMS
Steering Group to soon set up a website enabling them to publicise their
activities in a timely and efficient way.&nbsp; A link will then be placed on
this page for readers to follow the story.&nbsp; One issue that obviously needs
attention, judging from ad hoc comments in the village and what is quoted in the
previous paragraph, is that <u> people need to
be kept informed of the details (business plan etc) of what is intended</u> -
especially as preparations are being done by a group whose members have not been
'voted into office'.&nbsp; Their website will answer this point.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="3">UPDATE:
August 16th, 2007</font></b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130">In the dwell time while we wait
for a website announcement I draw attention briefly to a little bit of work I
have done on the history of the building and a minor revelation that has struck
me.&nbsp; I promise there will be only rare occasions like this when a bit of this website
look like personal blog.&nbsp; <a href="history.htm">Please read</a>.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>UPDATE:
August 19th, 2007</b></font></p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="left">Working with the SNC,
the group, Blisworth Historical Buildings Trust (BHBT), is trying to get a housing association to develop some flats as
affordable housing in the back and upper floors of the building.&nbsp; They are
also talking to developers so that we have another option if affordable housing
is not possible.&nbsp; They are also making a large number of applications for
funding and have received one grant of £500 which will help with our current
costs.&nbsp; One interesting possibility is the East Midlands Development Agency
as they have funding for regeneration relating to the canal.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
hope to develop a coffee shop and bistro in the front ground floor rooms.&nbsp;
This area will also be available as a village meeting place with potential for
heritage exhibitions and displays by other village organisations.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>UPDATE:
September 23rd, 2007</b></font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="left">There was to be a
Village Meeting on Thurs. 27th Sept at 7.30 in the Leisure Hall of the Baptist
Church but it was felt there were insufficient resolved issues to make the
meeting useful.&nbsp; It was later stated that the meeting was only postponed
for &quot;vital information&quot; and a new date - 25th October (same time and
venue) had been arranged - accordingly, the next update will be on the 25th
October!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>UPDATE:
October 26th, 2007</b></font>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="left">Owing to continuing
delays there is one major task to be completed before the SNC can judge the best
way to proceed with disposal of the building.&nbsp; SNC have acknowledged that a
mixed use, ie. <b>housing and commercial</b> (with a little heritage space
included), is desirable but require a detailed architectural survey to be done,
an operation referred to as an &quot;Options Appraisal&quot;, before picking a
route through this complex project.&nbsp; The question of where the funding will
come from to provide the heritage space is not resolved however.&nbsp; It seemed
that yesterdays meeting, in terms of new information, could have been delayed a
further 2 to 3 months but I am sure the village appreciated the offer of an
update.&nbsp; Further news is not
expected before June 2008 but the grant of money to carry out the detailed
architectural survey has been received and so the cost implications of a space
reserved for village use can be properly assessed.

</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="left"><font size="3">The
architectural survey, mentioned above, and the appraisal of options has
begun.&nbsp; The report from this activity will include:</font>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>UPDATE:
December 1, 2008 - Options Appraisal is near finished</b></font>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="left">The options
appraisal was finished and delivered to the <b>BHBT</b>.&nbsp; The
document analyses and costs various ways in which the building could be brought
up to full Grade II condition with the space used in various ways, namely; (i)
purely as housing, (ii) part housing (4 small units) with one business eg. cafe
and (iii) likewise with a small business run by community effort with various
community functions offered alongside.&nbsp; There is the suggestion that the
cellar space be used either for storage or extended office space.&nbsp; The cost
of the full restoration is thought to be estimated at £800,000 excluding the
purchase cost of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b> BHBT</b>&nbsp; presented a proposal based on the findings to the <b>SNC</b> on
December 1st (a week later than envisaged) and added that in recent discussions
within the village another interesting option had been raised - <u>a B&amp;B
business combined with some community space</u>.&nbsp; As this was seen by <b>BHBT</b>
as the now preferred option, the overall report needs to be filled out.&nbsp;
The &quot;final&quot; version is expected in January 2009 and will be presented
to the <b>SNC</b> for consideration.&nbsp; The <b>BHBT</b> preference seems to
be particularly problematical for the <b>SNC</b> to endorse (in that such a
design would have no accommodation for alternatives) - however, they are
expected to move forward towards a decision.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>UPDATE:
May 20, 2009 - SNC Decision Time</b></font>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 130" align="left"><font size="3">The
completed options appraisal has been presented to the <b>SNC</b> and they have
now reached a decision on the sort of future the building may enjoy.&nbsp; They
have engaged the services of &quot;The Towcester Partnership&quot; in order to
arrive at various viable financial plans.&nbsp; With all the &quot;stops pulled
out&quot;, ie. a building that is restored to Grade II standard, one that offers
the entire ground floor for community use and offers a cellar for community archives and
one that provides five one-bedroom flats that may be either marketed on the
free market or sold to Northamptonshire Homes plc., the purchase would involve <b>SNC</b>
handling a short-term cash deficit with a breakeven point in &quot;x
number of years&quot;.&nbsp; Thus the purchase problem has been solved in principle by <b>TTP
</b>but, nevertheless, <b>SNC</b> might find the arrangement unattractive and
simply sell the building to a developer.&nbsp; Mid-September 2009 is now seen as
a time when plans should be resolved.</font>
