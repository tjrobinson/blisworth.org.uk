        The village-oriented development project has been abandonned</b></span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">On
        September 4th a few 'options appraisal' reports, prepared by the <b>BHBT</b>,
        were distributed at the Heritage Day &quot;Blisworth Past and
        Present&quot; in the Village Hall.&nbsp; It should be remembered that
        detail on the planning of the project had not been forthcoming for many
        months yet at that time, 5 weeks before the <b>SNC</b> were expected to
        announce a decision on how to proceed, a version of the report
        is made available.&nbsp; It was edited in the sense that
        the detail was sparse (perhaps for the sake of its readability) and the
        details of the financial model constructed by <b>TTP</b> was couched in
        a section that was not publicly available.&nbsp; It was stated there were three
        options (1). to sell the building on the open-market with a book loss of
        £200000 generated by the collapse in building valuation since the time
        of the <b>CPO</b> and wasted project
        work (2). to lease the building to a management firm whilst retaining
        asset ownership with SNC and (3). to leave the building with a beefed-up
        <b>
        BHBT</b> to be managed until finances develop to the point when the building
        could be sold without incurring a book loss.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
        sudden release of the document left many wondering <i> why on
        earth was there so much secrecy before then</i> and why the document was
        released as a single document to the Parish Council (<b>PC</b>) with
        only one of their meetings scheduled before the <b>SNC</b> decision
        time.&nbsp; It was stated that the details <i>had</i> been discussed at
        times as far back as two years ago but that was in terms of bland
        phrases such as &quot;a space suitable for a bistro-type business&quot;;
        no schematics, no numbers and no plans at all.&nbsp; So, now in September there
        was, at least, a plan (that is reproduced in the diagram below) and an appended
        financial model for some to read.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's not
        forget, in terms of a filled-out architectural solution, there has been
        no public/village airing of this project.</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>First reactions</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; First reactions to this plan
        include the feeling that the cafe/bistro space at 7m by 5m is small
        (there seems to be room only for about 25 seats at tables) yet
        the expected rental value is set in the financial summing up at £1000
        pcm - which seems very optimistic, as that's an annual average, but
        maybe the guts of the financial model is not fragile!&nbsp; The resource room and the meeting room may make sense
        especially knowing that a spacious cellar will be available for storage
        and even some office space.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>Subsequent Events</b>&nbsp;
        The reaction to the plan was one of mild enthusiasm yet absolutely
        nothing sprung from it.&nbsp; The Towcester Partnership, that was
        master-minding the financial plan, in the meantime fragmented and then
        disbanded.&nbsp; Villagers were left with no point of contact until in
        March 2010 it was hinted that the community project would fail and maybe
        the building would be disposed of on the open market.&nbsp; A <b>SNC</b>
        cabinet meeting held on 12th April 2010 evidently confirmed the decision
        to dispose of the building but, at this point (21 April), a firm
        confirmation of that is not available.&nbsp; In any event the building
        remains as a Grade II listed structure and will be treated
        appropriately.&nbsp; All the work by Mrs. D. Burgoyne and her group over
        the past three years has been quite literally wasted, that's all their
        work and over £10000 of funding for the charity group <b>BHBT</b> (Blisworth
        Historic Buildings Trust).&nbsp; Their detailed plans prepared by
        consultant architects are unlikely to be of use to a new owner.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><a name="final stages"></a>  <b>What
        was thought to be the 'Final Stages'</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously the village now
        look forward to hearing of an appropriate development plan which is
        quickly put into action - we certainly do not wish to see this building
        remain derelict for another spell.&nbsp; Unfortunately the offer for
        purchase by <b>SNC</b> was not received well and the resolution of a
        satisfactory purchase price was attempted at a Land Tribunal in August
        2010.&nbsp; However, the chairman merely gave guidelines and instructed
        Mrs. Tew and the <b>SNC</b> to reach agreement on that basis.&nbsp; This
        was done, though the sale price has not been disclosed.&nbsp; By January
        2011 the council had placed the property in the hands of an estate agent
        who declared the guideline sale price to be in the region of £350000
        (high enough to draw a veil over maybe only a 5 figure book-loss) and in late May 2011 it was
        proclaimed to be &quot;under offer&quot;.&nbsp; The name of the new owner and
        his/her immediate plan will be bulletined here as soon as they are known
        - however, in November 2011 the saga showed a sign of continuing when we
        discovered the offer had been withdrawn, thus raising again toward year
        end the spectre of that book-loss.&nbsp; It has been suggested around
        Feb 2012 (by the
        Blisworth Heritage Society) that some of the difficult planning
        conditions imposed by the <b>SNC</b> on any prospective buyer might be
        relaxed, to ease the sale.&nbsp; In this regard, they
        have suggested de-listing the property to ease a number of planning
        conditions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these matters were part and parcel of
        the terms of the compulsory purchase and for the <b>SNC</b> to now alter
        them would potentially place them in a position analogous to
        &quot;breach of contract&quot;.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The Final Stages&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;
        &nbsp; A new prospective buyer appeared early in 2012.&nbsp; Rather than
        loose him because of the usual difficulties the <b>SNC</b> decided to
        review their approach to a deal after a consultative phase again with
        the <b>PC</b>.&nbsp; On May 28, 2012, the PC met, in an open meeting, to
        review their opinions about the building.&nbsp; Options for the <b>SNC</b>
        were perceived as the following; (i) continue as at present, (ii) drop
        the sale price&nbsp; (iii) relax conditions, incl. the listing&nbsp;
        (iv) donate to the village&nbsp; (v) enter a joint venture with a
        builder and have 'social homes' and (vi) resurrect the <b>BHBT</b> and
        go for new funding for a community element plus housing.&nbsp; The
        meeting was of the usual format with these options being discussed,
        sometimes with only two people voicing an opinion, never with any vote
        taken.&nbsp; Option six was rejected owing to there being plenty of
        community space and the village was 'tired' of this subject.&nbsp;
        Option five did not attract much discussion though one voiced the
        opinion that social housing at that particular location was not a good
        idea.&nbsp; (Note that the <b>PC</b> had previously 'encouraged' 33 new
        social houses and only 11 would be provided by the future Chapel Hill
        Farm development).&nbsp; Time was pressing so option one was not
        favoured.&nbsp; Finally option four was rejected for the same reason as
        option six, expressed as &quot;the village doesn't want a financial
        millstone&quot;.&nbsp; This left just the feeling that a lower price and
        a relaxation of conditions would surely bring in a buyer.&nbsp;
        Conditions were suggested to ensure a future owner does promptly get on
        with it and render a tidy and useful asset.&nbsp; The entire discussion
        took only 60 minutes, a letter in response to the <b>SNC</b> would be
        quickly drafted.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>July 2012</b>&nbsp; It was
        announced that the building was sold in July (to a builder living in
        Tiffield?) subject to contract. After a few more months it was realised
        that negotiations were continuing and by December one wondered, with
        trepidation, whether the deal may fall through. Managers at the <b>SNC</b>
        maintained a strict secrecy.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>August 2013</b>&nbsp;
        Around the time of our canal festival some noticed that the &quot;Sold
        subject to Contract&quot; sticker had come off <b>SNC</b>s sign on the
        front of the building. It has since been announced that (a) there is an
        easement of the planning restrictions on prospective developers and (b).
        the Council are indeed again inviting bids for purchase.&nbsp; In short,
        there has been no progress whilst the building continues to slowly
        become more and more distressed - the <b>SNC</b>s first mooting of a CPO
        for the building was in 2004 by the way.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>November 2014</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Finally
        sold to a developer with the aim of creating ~5 flats. At last!</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>December 2015</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The abovementioned deal feel through. On Dec 7th 2015 a Mr. Nicholas
        Fuller outlined a project having details that apparently satisfy all
        directly concerned. It will, we are told shortly appear in the
        applications list for planning permission. The development is densely
        packed into the available space. A total of six flats, some of which
        will use the underground basement (cellar) and one of which will be
        accommodated in a new extension (replacing the 'kitchen' destroyed by a
        colliding lorry), are squeezed in and 8 car-parking spaces are given in
        the grounds. In the western corner of the grounds is placed a four
        bedroom detached house, given a sympathetic treatment in terms of style,
        and between it and the main building there is provided an access drive
        area for the already existing house built some months ago. At the
        presentation to the village the issue of too limited car-parking was
        justified as consistent with <b>SNC</b> recommendations and cannot be
        eased without the project becoming financially non-viable. Thus the
        financial conditions inherited from earlier arrangements have a knock-on
        into the present. I look forward to this project succeeding but doubt
        that the mistakes relating to cost and EH conditions could be more
        pointedly shown up.</font></p>
