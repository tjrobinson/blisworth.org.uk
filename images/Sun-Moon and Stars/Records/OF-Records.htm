        <font color="#000080">Through the good offices of the <i>The Oddfellows</i>
        association at Wellingborough we were fortunate to discover that their local records had been lodged
        at the N.R.O. in 2009.&nbsp; The main document studied covers the members
        at Blisworth joining from 1849 to 1960.&nbsp; Why this record book did not start at
        1842, when the Lodge was created at the Inn (then called The Half Moon
        Inn), is a mystery.&nbsp; There is another record book which covers 1841
        to 1847 but with a format that only states the 'brothers' who proposed and
        seconded the people who joined.&nbsp; The list of these 'founder' brothers in 1841 runs to 26
        names which are given at the bottom of the page and in that year, the
        year before the formal formation of the Lodge, there was quite an influx of 18
        people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Returning to the main 1849 record book, the
        numbers joining and the proportion of them from Blisworth is plotted in
        the diagram to the left.&nbsp; The zero of the numbers scale is a guess
        based on the number of founders and the number joined in the first 6
        years.&nbsp; There is an implication that the formation of a small Odd
        Fellow group might have occurred well before 1841 because so many
        reliable members were prepared to introduce others.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">As the main record book covers from 1849 to
        1958 and includes date of birth, parish lived in, date of marriage and
        death and a few other details such as whether the person was ever fined
        for poor conduct, it is a valuable resource for family research.&nbsp;
        The record has been cut off at the date 1940 and formed into a <a href="bmd-OFs.pdf"> PDF
        (19 MB) for
        download here</a>.&nbsp; It is a help to know that the people joining,
        especially in Victorian times, tended to do so at the youngest age
        possible which was initially 18 years but reduced to 17 years after a
        while.&nbsp; There was also set up a Lodge for juniors, for which the
        joining age was 12 years.&nbsp; Little is known of this Lodge, called
        Simmonds Lodge, based presumably in a private Blisworth residence and
        set up in 1889 (according to GF notes).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Initially only 25 to 30% of those joining were
        from Blisworth.&nbsp; This emphasises the fact that the Lodge is called
        a Travellers' Lodge.&nbsp; Perhaps many were related to Blisworth
        families and joined because they knew they would be available for
        meetings.&nbsp; This is not clear for it is said that non-attendance was
        punishable by fine and so relations would perhaps need to be quite
        'local'. &nbsp; In fact, at least three people joining were
        publicans from other inns - an interesting connection!&nbsp; However, in
        1885, some brothers wanted to relocate the Lodge in an unlicensed place
        presumably to avoid the distractions, according to a minute book
        covering 1884 to 1892.&nbsp; There was a vote - 16 in favour,
        16 against and it was resolved to hold a ballot soon after (the decision
        has not been found).&nbsp; The
        Lodge was moved eventually to the Royal Oak and in 1955 was evicted to
        the Baptists' Lecture Hall.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The year 1875 marks the introduction of an Act
        of Parliament that sought to remove relatively dodgy building societies
        as investment houses and promoted the growing trend in friendly
        societies.&nbsp; In the diagram <b>L</b> denotes the Lodge
        formation, <b>S</b> a very substantial pulse of extra people joining
        in 1912 and 1913.&nbsp; From 1890 to 1906 the working class enjoyed a
        rising standard of living and developed through the trade union movement
        a greater expectation of 'respect and sharing' from the employers.&nbsp;
        By 1911 many grievances were being expressed and there was a national
        railways strike (among many other strikes).&nbsp; Along with the
        probably lessening of security in the two quarrying companies in the
        village the conditions on the railways&nbsp; would be likely very
        unsettling.&nbsp; In fact there was also a radical surge in Blisworth in
        1911 and the political unrest was <a href="../../Articles/housing.htm">reported
        in newspapers</a> at the time.&nbsp; Maybe the aftermath of all that
        caused many villagers to join the order.&nbsp; It centred on the
        shortcomings of the main landlord, Duke of Grafton, who was not
        providing sufficient housing.&nbsp; <b>V</b>,
        for victory, denotes the end of the <b> WWII</b> and a marked fall in joining
        rate as the 1948 National Health Service was started.&nbsp; Incidentally,
        from c1912 until 1948 the Oddfellows Groups made collections for the
        National Health Insurance as local agents for the central government
        scheme before the health service came into existence.&nbsp; There was
        also a &quot;State Insurance&quot; the role of which is presently
        obscure - read more at <a href="http://www.nationalfriendly.co.uk/Heritage/">http://www.nationalfriendly.co.uk</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The various record books indicate that there
        were degrees, or attainment levels, for members.&nbsp; Lowest was
        'White', then came in sequence 'Blue', 'Scarlet', 'Gold' and
        'Purple'.&nbsp; Those with the 'Purple' degree were officers - G (Grand)
        and NG (&nbsp; ), each with both left-hand men and right-hand men.&nbsp;
        This group of six officers, wearing long sashes, ran the meetings and defined policy but there was also Tyler, in
        a white gown, whose job was to be a doorman able to ascertain
        membership and turn away strangers and nuisances - much of the practice
        and ceremony within the meetings was secret just as it is with Masonic
        groups.&nbsp; As groups modernised much of the attainment degree detail
        was set aside and ordinary officials such as Treasurer and Secretary
        were adopted - sashes were retained in <a href="../../People-two.htm#paxton">Blisworth
        up to the 1960s</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">It has been stated that the earliest formation
        of Oddfellows, alongside the grouping of merchants or burghers in towns, was
        illegal.&nbsp; This was certainly true of trade unions in c1800 and
        Oddfellows were indeed a type of trade union.&nbsp; Given that the
        Oddfellows were, in the main, forming a friendly society and not hiding
        active trade unionism (ie. discontentment <i>between</i> employers and
        working classes) behind that facade there was turned a blind eye to
        them.&nbsp; The name 'Odd Fellows' is said to stem from the definition
        &quot;miscellaneous artisans and tradesmen&quot; <i>outside</i> the town
        merchant group or &quot;The Guild&quot;.&nbsp; They formed their own group to enhance their
        influence and to support each other.&nbsp; More on 'aims of the groups' is <a href="../naming.htm">given
        in a related article</a>.</font></p>
