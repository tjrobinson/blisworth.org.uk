        imposing building at the site of the former Sun, Moon and Stars Inn,
        this being for the year 1729.&nbsp; The Duke of Grafton's rent records
        show that the building is his and that in 1740 a Cath Morris, too poor
        to pay much rent, lives in a partially collapsed building that was once a
        'publick house of some note - the Chequers Alehouse'.&nbsp; The woman
        died in 1749 and the next news about the place is when a Mr. Thomas
        Smith sells the building to John Linnett on 19 May 1797.&nbsp; John
        Linnett rebuilt in brick using some stone walls that still stood.&nbsp;
        He established a new
        inn to take advantage of the trade relating to the canal.&nbsp; There
        was, of course, space in the field running down to the new canal which
        had been dug only two years earlier but we have no idea what outbuildings, if
        any, were built there.&nbsp; Local lore has it, with not a
        single supporting fact, that workmen dealing with the tunnel lodged
        there until the tunnel was finished in 1805 and much later, a band of
        registered leggers lived there.&nbsp; The latter assertion seems
        particularly dubious.&nbsp; John Linnett called his new inn
        the 'Half Moon Inn' and, by 1841, the place was called 'The Half Moon Yard' in
        the census.<br>
        Fortunately the 1838 survey carried out by the Duke of Grafton provides
        much detail on the buildings established by then - see the left hand
        panel below.&nbsp; The panels below just show the triangular patch of
        ground between the canal and the High Street.&nbsp; The inn is the L-shaped section and it had two
        attached out-buildings and one small detached building nearer to the
        canal.&nbsp; By then the inn was owned by Mr. Phipps, of brewing and
        ironstone mining fame, as was a small plot of land immediately to the
        east of the plot.&nbsp; The Victorian censuses record that Half Moon
        Yard provided accommodation for a number of households but there is no
        indication whether they are in the outbuildings or in the main three
        storey building.&nbsp; Interestingly, the 1970 ordnance survey shows the
        situation after there were four cottages established to the
        west of the main building and three more to the east in 1891.&nbsp; These
        cottages were, of course, built by the Phipps family on their own
        land.&nbsp; Note that the original outbuilding of 1838 behind the main
        building has evidently formed the shell for the four new cottages and
        that the other outbuilding provided at least the outline for the
        accommodation for kitchens in 1977.&nbsp; This latter outbuilding
        survived until 1988 when a lorry from the High Street demolished it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even part of
        the outline of the little detached out- building seems to survive.<br>
        <br>
        From some time in the 1840s the inn had two names; the original 'Half
        Moon' and the new 'Sun and Moon' or 'Sun, Moon &amp; Stars' or even
        '...Seven Stars'.&nbsp; As indicated on the website, the new names
        probably came from the logos used by the Oddfellows Society which was
        using the inn as their lodge.&nbsp; Kelly's directories and the brewery
        adopted the new name(s) while many villagers at least until the WW I
        used the old name.</font></p>

        brick in 1797.&nbsp; There is a date-stone displaying '<b>J L 1797</b>' on the wall of the main
        building which faces south.&nbsp; It appears to have been placed midway
        between the two prominent bay-windows that are shown on the 1838 map.&nbsp;
        It has recently become evident that the date 'stone' is not made of
        stone but is instead a carefully flattened 1 inch layer of lime mortar
        into which the lettering was cut with a trowel.&nbsp; The practice
        suggests that John Linnett was not a man to waste money on such detail.&nbsp; The layer of mortar is becoming detached in places.&nbsp;
        He also evidently did not waste much money on the employment of skilled
        brick-layers as the work, done in Flemish bond style, is not to a high
        standard.&nbsp; Even the choice of brick seems suspect; on the north
        wall there is much seep-through of tar from chimneys that were built
        onto the interior of the outside wall.&nbsp; This shows that the bricks
        are rather porous there.&nbsp; If that is true for all the exterior
        walling then the mortar between the course of bricks must have been
        subject to some weakening by the percolation of rainwater over 200
        years.<br>
        <br>
        The walls of the building show some evidence of changes to brickwork and windows etc. over
        the years but little can prepare one for the riddle presented by the
        south wall of the main building.&nbsp; This building was listed in 1989
        and it must bear consideration that this wall be either rendered to
        cover the shame or left exposed to encourage us to explain the changes -
        a project for an architectural historian.&nbsp; But there is a better
        option below.<br>
        <br>
        This south wall is shown
        below, a good example of the result of a building being adapted purely
        for use with no regard for appearances.</font></p>

        lines superimposed on the image draw attention to the most obvious
        re-bricking.&nbsp; The two light blue bars are placed with reference to
        the 1838 map which shows a pair of bay windows on this wall.&nbsp; There
        seem to be four openings that were once used. None have been re-bricked
        in Flemish bond and none seem to relate to the vestiges of such large bay windows.&nbsp;
        The vertical panel to the right might have been where a flue had been
        once placed, built against the exterior wall.&nbsp; The date-stone is
        shown centrally and seems to have been partially covered for a while by
        a pitch roof (though the precise detail of that pitch is
        questionable).&nbsp; Slightly left of centre at ground level there is a
        section of wall (?) built as a block of concrete which suggests it is
        either a
        piece of wallplate (rustic!) placed there to stabilise a portion of the
        wall or part of a loading bay for beer barrels etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parts of the wall have been
        re-pointed and this fact
        makes it appear, in a picture this small, that much has been
        rebuilt.&nbsp; In fact the upper two storeys of brickwork appear to be
        mostly the original.<br>
        <br>
        The adjacent wall does not appear to have received much attention from
        revisions.&nbsp; Although the brickwork is in Flemish bond the
        decorative lintel arrangement is not identical to that over the three
        first floor windows facing south.&nbsp; Should we attribute this
        difference to John
        Linnett and his work force?<br>
        <br>
        <font size="4"><b>A Proposal:</b> </font>&nbsp; The fact is the
        south wall has most of its hideous patchwork at the ground-floor
        level.&nbsp; Why not, in a process of restoration, re-build two large
        bay windows to recall the appearance of the building in 1838 and hide
        the hideous?&nbsp; Then, why not incorporate these bay windows into a slightly
        elevated patio which provides the connection between the car-park area
        and the interior ground floor?&nbsp; The patio could be fairly large and
        could offer an interesting outdoor area for a cafe/bistro
        business.&nbsp; The removal from the whole building of every square inch of disfiguring black
        paint and magnolia wash along with the re-building of the two bay
        windows on the front elevation (re-establishing correct glazing rules
        there) would help obtain harmony for the overall
        exterior.&nbsp; However, there's no need for a prescription at this
        stage; it's simple - <b>cover up the hideous with restoration 19th
        century glazing!</b></font></td>
