<p align="center" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><b><font size="5" color="#000080">THE MAP OF THE TUNNEL ROAD,
1807</font></b></p>

<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font size="3" color="#000080">Buried in George Freeston's records is a
photocopy of a map of the toll road built across Blisworth Hill which was
initially intended to carry freight between Blisworth and Stoke Bruerne while
the tunnel was being built.&nbsp; Some aspects of the map suggest it may have
been a deposited map at the beginning of the project; the configuration
of the roads which extend onwards to each village beyond the tunnel portals
appear very
schematic.&nbsp; Unfortunately the date of the map is not readable, because it
was so damaged by damp, and the
reference for the map in terms of its location in the NRO is absent.&nbsp;Recently
the map has been found in the NRO as G 4133/2, probably restored to full colours
in the recent years.&nbsp; The map was obviously drawn to indicate to the Duke
of Grafton the acreage associated with different parts of the canal
scheme.&nbsp; The very beginning of the Northampton Arm is shown while the
over-hill railway is not.&nbsp; The map is in fact dated Oct 20th, 1807 and was
associated with a conveyance for the land from the Grafton estate to the canal
company.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font size="3" color="#000080">The
map is shown below - remember to use the scrollbars, both horizontal and
vertical, to see at the features.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><img border="0" src="canl&amp;tunnel1810,sm.jpg" width="1800" height="528"></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">There are a number
of features of interest.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">1.&nbsp; We know
the <a href="../Articles/Roman-Salt-Way.html"> line of the Saltway</a> as Knock Lane
rather than Nock Lane.&nbsp; It is unknown how
early the name was used but it does seem plausible as the
original name since it
could refer to notch-like oak trees grown for the main structural part of
cottage gables; the lane at one time passed through forest.&nbsp; The award map
of much the same date shows the lane as Plain Lane.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">2.&nbsp;
Near Knock Lane are a series of fields with the name &quot;Cockshots&quot;.&nbsp;
The name suggests they were somewhat wooded and used for catching woodcocks by
stringing up nets.&nbsp; &quot;Shot&quot; implies a strip of field along a
boundary, or comprising a boundary.&nbsp; The boundary could be the western
boundary to the common land known as &quot;The Plain&quot; between Blisworth,
Roade and Stoke Bruerne.&nbsp; Hence, to the east of the tunnel road was the un-inclosed
common land and to the west, fields tenanted by farmers, eg Mr Wilson at
Blisworth Hill Farm.&nbsp; Note also that the gamekeeper lived at Buttermilk
Hall.&nbsp; By 1840 an Act of Parliament saw that all farm land was inclosed,
though in Blisworth the Award was made in 1808 - 1815.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">3.&nbsp; The map
shows that the initial intention was to have a toll gate near to Knock Lane, see
&quot;Turnpike Gage&quot;.&nbsp;
At the gate charges would be based on the weight of goods being carried, hence the
need for someone to 'gauge (gage) the weights'.&nbsp; There were remains of a
cottage near to Blisworth Hill farm, removed in 1976, which local lore suggests
was the actual toll house and there is a photograph of this <a href="tollhouse-query.jpg"> cottage in the
NRO</a> which was demolished in the 1970s.&nbsp; That the toll gate was actually near the
farm location (not built in 1800) just north of Berry Hill, might be correct.&nbsp; The award map,
however, does
show a small vacant plot, to the west of the road, in exactly the spot marked
'gage' shown on this
map thus suggesting its intended location - at least.&nbsp; Tolls
would have been excised from roughly 1795 to 1800, the latter date being when
the over-hill horse-railway was built.</font> </p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080"><a name="berryhill"></a>4.&nbsp; The toll
road, labelled the 'tunnel road', makes a detour around a field called Berry
Hill.&nbsp; Hitherto, it has been assumed that the road was kinked to
accommodate the somewhat kinked line of the horse-railway also known as the <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/HillRailway.htm">tramway
or the hill railway</a>.&nbsp; Conjecturally, the
name 'Berry
Hill' rings of an earlier corrupted name, namely Bury or Burial
Hill being a place remote from villages where, in the years of the 17th century
plague, the bodies of deceased could be more safely interred.&nbsp; At a time
130 years later, when the road was to be built, perhaps no-one was prepared to disturb that ground.&nbsp;
This not entirely fanciful thought will not be welcome to the present farmer at
Blisworth Hill farm!&nbsp; In one of George Freeston's notes he refers to there
being once &quot;three ancient tumuli at Bury Hill, the last surviving to 1985
when it was obliterated by ploughing&quot;.&nbsp; There is no indication where
this reference was found and the above-mentioned map shows nothing of tumuli.&nbsp;
However, Wetton's Guide to Northampton and its Vicinity, 1849, clearly refers to
a significant tumuli whose form is part-obscured by waste from the tunnel
excavation.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">Read about some problems for <a href="../Blisworth&#32;Tunnel/ludlams.htm">miners
sinking some of the pits</a> for the tunnel.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">5.&nbsp; Buttermilk
field and its associated little cottage, Buttermilk Hall, was probably set up by the Duke
of Grafton for his gamekeeper.&nbsp; By law, the line of the road was expected to follow
closely the line of the tunnel and so the road would cut through the
gamekeeper's field.&nbsp; It would be reasonable for there to be gated access
across that field to allow the gamekeeper to retain animals - but only one gate
is shown.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">6.&nbsp;
The line of the parish boundary is today much nearer to buttermilk field.&nbsp;
The line of the road continuing to Stoke Bruerne takes a wider arc to the west
before joining the Stoke to Shutlanger road.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">7.&nbsp;
It is interesting that the inclosures and the common field appear to have a
boundary not far from where Station Road would come today.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">8.&nbsp;
Also interesting is the beginnings of the Northampton Arm as a little branch
connected to a horse railway.&nbsp; The location of this <a href="../Canal/horse_rail_wharf.htm">little
branch can be found today</a>.&nbsp; Note that there are no buildings at all
near there - Blisworth Arm as a hamlet did not exist in c. 1810.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="padding-left: 12; padding-right: 100"><font color="#000080">9.
Note also the prominent green band across the canal, labelled in red by TM,
which seems more like an ancient green lane than a mere baulk between lands.</font></p>
