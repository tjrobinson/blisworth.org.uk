        - June 2009</b></font></p>
  </center>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">A long awaited upgrade to the play
        equipment at the Play Park has been planned and financed by the Parish Council.&nbsp;
        In the early days of June the first phase of the installation took place
        and will enormously please the 4 - 13 year olds that seek village entertainment!&nbsp;
      The equipment was made fully available by 10 June and comprised of two new
      swings units, a bouncy seesaw and a slide and climb unit.&nbsp; There will be a
      formal opening on 25 July to coincide with a fund raising event in the
      Village Hall and on the Play Park.&nbsp; A second group of park 'toys'
      will be installed later this year and the whole will be surrounded by a
      stylish fence to discourage encroachment of dogs onto the grass.&nbsp; The
      centre part of the area will be kept clear for games and events, as it
      always has been since the park was established through the kindness of <a href="../Articles/Fields&amp;Allotments.html#buswell" style="color: #00FFFF">Buswell
      Company</a> who ran a business known as the &quot;Bacon factory&quot; from
      around 1920 - 1970 near this location.</font></p>

            Some seats and some picnic tables along with a small roundabout
            nearby were provided and officially made available on September 12th
            thus filling out the project of regenerating the sports and games

        Council.</font>
            <p align="left" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><font color="#FFFFFF">Just 45 years ago, to almost the day, the Village Hall
        &amp; Playing Fields Association had managed to acquired the six acres
        of &quot;<a href="../Articles/Fields&amp;Allotments.html#field" style="color: #00FFFF">Parish Lands</a>&quot; from the Northamptonshire County
        Council.&nbsp; They had laid grass for football and cricket pitches and
            established a rudimentary pavilion for the football clubs, with
            changing rooms and showers.&nbsp; The occasion was celebrated by a
            40 yard race for youngsters across the new grass - Major Hereward
            Wake with the starting pistol.&nbsp; The money required, £3365, was assembled with an&nbsp; Education
        Grant of about £1000, a £1900 sum collected by villagers in fund
        raising and a small loan that was soon to be paid
        off.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association was formed in 1945 and the following 19
            years after that was needed to accumulate the £1900. Prime movers
            in 1964 were Parish Cllr. Rivett, Cllr. Sid Whitmore and a new
            village headmaster - Len Piggott.</font>

 Timothy James Spooner
        who died at Blisworth on 17th. May 2008 aged 21 yr.<br>

        06.06.2008</b>&nbsp; <font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">A few villagers, led by Jane
        Percival, have managed
        to place in reservation the funding that will be needed and have tried
        to find a suitable site - not with much initial success at this time.&nbsp;
        The shelter is intended to be simply a
        shelter against the weather and a meeting place for village teenagers -
        the age range 15 to 19 years is to be catered for.&nbsp; The shelter
        would have no door and would not be subject to any adult
        supervision but would be maintained by the VH&amp;PF Association.</font></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>23.06.2008&nbsp; </b>The
        proposed location of the youth shelter had boiled
        down to between two places; (1) on land adjacent to the Royal Oak (well over
        towards the left, as viewed from the High Street) - presently
        being considered by the owner of the Royal Oak and (2) on 'playing field' land near the
        football club.&nbsp;
        The first of these is more favoured by the project organisers and the
        police.&nbsp; The decision of the Royal Oak owners has been long awaited.</font>
        <p>
        <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>08.07.2008&nbsp; </b>The shelter is to be installed in the only remaining place for which there was general
        agreement; adjacent to the Football Club buildings and the playing
        fields.&nbsp; The location is analogous to the nearby installations at Old
        Stratford and Greens Norton which are on their respective recreation
        fields.</font>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>23.08.2008 - </b>Installation was completed.&nbsp;
        As will be evident in the photograph, the shelter is very
        modern in design, being a two part dome made of steel tubing and transparent durable
        polycarbonate sheet over a nice circular suite of yellow seats.&nbsp; It may be eventually equipped with
        its own street light or with solar-powered lighting, which turns on automatically as darkness
        falls, if the need is demonstrated.&nbsp;There is to be a bike-rack and
        litter bin nearby. The shelter is expected to greatly appeal to our
        youngsters who had a hand, literally, in installing the concrete floor,
        leaving hand prints and scribed initials for posterity in the hardening
        concrete.&nbsp; The shelter will also be a 'fun place' for toddlers,
        judging from the photograph, and will be a good resting place for
        walkers and casual football spectators; indeed it is an asset to the
        village.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 25"><font color="#FFFFFF">That this project has been brought to fruition
        despite, at times, encountering difficult circumstances is due to the perseverance of Jane
        Percival.&nbsp; Amongst the small band of helpers, the
        efforts of Clare Dunckley and Alan Hargreaves particularly stand
        out.&nbsp; Well done!
