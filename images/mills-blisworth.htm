<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">That the place now known as Blisworth
was suited for a
settlement would have been noticed by mankind thousands of years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is a sheltered valley with a small stream into which flows a number
of good springs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Owing to the shape of the valley, water catchment into
the stream extends over an area of 2 square miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
Corn was originally </span>stone-milled either by hand or with the power of oxen
and it was the Romans who introduced the watermill to Britain.&nbsp; The Blisworth
stream would barely be an adequate power source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was
a Roman villa or temple half a mile west of the 'village' with dated artifacts
c. 200AD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is maybe a trace of a
more military-style presence of Romans, presumably c. 70AD, in the interesting
alignment of a straight-line pathway joining the position of the church tower
and the highest point on Gayton Hill, to the west, which is within 100 yards of
the site of the villa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For this to
be significant, one must assume that the bluff on which Blisworth Church stands
was once a camp - indeed, it seems the place would have been a camp or stockade
from Norman times to those of the Wakes c. 1450 but a specific mention of the <u><a href="Bridges-history.htm">location</a></u><a href="Bridges-history.htm">
of Wake's 'seat'</a>, just to the south of the church, is dated 1718.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The first mention of 'organised'
milling in Blisworth is in the Domesday Book, 1086.&nbsp;&nbsp; A freely
Anglicised and
extended version of the Domesday entry follows:<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 4.0pt; padding-left: 40; padding-right: 70"><font color="#000080"><i>Being a son of William the Conqueror, the &quot;knight&quot;
William Peverel<b>&nbsp;</b> owns many estates in England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, in this County, he holds four manors, one of which comprised 400
acres at Blisworth (Blidesworde,
</i> probably pronounced 'blithesworth'<i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Within
his own farm there are 200 acres which are cultivated with 2 ploughs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are 12 common villagers and 6 small-holders and they have 7 ploughs
- making 9 ploughs in all.<o:p>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 4.0pt; padding-left: 40; padding-right: 70"><i><font color="#000080">There
is a mill on a small stream valued at 2 shillings per
year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are 4 acres of common
meadow and one and a half square miles of common woodland - this being
equivalent to 960 acres.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The total
holding at Blisworth is therefore 1360 acres.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">The stream, now known as Fisher
Brook - the only one that could have supported any milling, delivers water at the
rate of only gallons per minute in the dry seasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with a large millpond it is unlikely that water milling
could continue throughout the year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
will return to this point but for now it seems perfectly reasonable that such a
low valuation was placed on the mill in 1086, a fifteenth of that for the mill
on the River Tove at Towcester, on account of the seasonal flow.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">Milling with the power from wind-sails is thought to have
been introduced in England not before 1300.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have documented references to wind-milling at Blisworth as far back as
the 17th century but the earliest specific site for a mill is mentioned in the
mid-18th on a Grafton map -
on a hill known as Cliff Hill.<o:p>&nbsp; The Northampton Record Office archives many wills and a
search reveals a Mr Symson, miller, died in 1650 with nothing in his will
hinting which type of mill he used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
1704 the will of William Dent and that of John Dent in 1730 indicate they were
millers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>John Dent's will refers to
toll corn, mill bills, bushels and sails of cloth.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So he operated a windmill.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">One of the complicating factors regarding Fisher Brook is
that it was diverted to fill the Grand Junction Canal in 1795.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The canal company, by law, were obliged to buy out any millers using
water which is taken for the canal and in 1794 is recorded the purchase of a
(water) mill and garden from a Richard Dent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On a map of probable <a href="Canal/1811Canal-PondBank.htm">canal company
authorship, c. 1820</a>, a building is labelled
&quot;Dent's Mill&quot;.<o:p>&nbsp; The <a href="blisworth_water_mill.htm">1729
Grafton map</a> clearly shows the mill.</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">From the above it appears that the Dent family operated both
a water mill and a windmill, not necessarily at the same time but when one
considers that the water mill could not be operated much in the summer then it
seems more than likely that Dents were in charge of both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it gets more complicated than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first proper mapping of the Grafton estate in 1729 shows Blisworth
with its watermill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An annex map to the
main one shows a windmill on Cliff Hill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maps
were drawn in those times to aid the management of rents and the miller's rent
arrangement would still be based on medieval principles - freehold with a tax on
the amount milled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In showing <a href="1727-map.htm">the
water mill</a> (see <a href="blisworth_water_mill.htm">also</a>), the map clearly indicates a millpond of very modest size located
at the lower end of a field that was once the full millpond (Pond Bank Leys).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seems the pond had totally silted up and by 1729 the stream had been
dug out all the way across the millpond to drain into a reservoir, some 200 yards by 40 yards,
next to the mill wheel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly this reservoir was mainly to provide a means of continuing the
draining of the field, being composed of excellent alluvium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The reservoir would provide water for milling only through the wettest
part of the year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that the
brook was also known as Winterbrook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
was the stake in milling which was bought from Richard Dent in 1794.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no record when the Duke decided to drain the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe a study of the silting process could help in judging when
water-milling was so compromised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Using
Ordnance Survey data, a</span>
survey was made of the likely original stream bed with the conclusion that the
height of the mill dam is/was 13 feet and this allows us to estimate the volume
of silt behind the dam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
tonnage of silt, according to one expert, could have
accumulated within as little as 200 years bearing in mind the size of the
rainfall catchment area. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A more
realistic estimate is ~1000 years because all the fields in the catchment were
either wooded or set to grass before 1700 and this would protect them from
erosion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When this field was being prepared for building development (<a href="Pondbank.htm#draining">Pond
Bank</a>) in the late 60s, a culvert at a depth of over 13 feet was set near to
the dam to drain the area more thoroughly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A fresh water mollusc was found in the silt at the bottom - confirming
there was once either a stream bed there or the bottom of a pond.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">From such slender evidence a conjectural picture of Blisworth
milling may be painted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pre-Norman
times saw the start of water milling using a dam that needed to be raised
occasionally to cope with the accumulation of silt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>By the 14th century the village acquired its stone <a href="church.htm"> church</a> and perhaps a
windmill too in order for the miller to cope better with demands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From that time, the miller would use both mills according to the weather.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that milling needed to be an all-year
activity because corn was too bulky to be stored indoors and that policy would
risk rat infestation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was stored
on-the-ear in ricks raised on &quot;staddle&quot; stones to combat rats and with thatched covers to
ward off sparrows and the weather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
any flour that had been milled by the traditional stone method would not keep
long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At some point the millpond
became somewhat silted and/or waterlogged so that for much of the year it was
neither a useful source of mill water nor a viable meadow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed it probably was the source of undesirable weed seeds and smells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe it was thought impracticable to raise the mill dam further since
the resultant larger pond would loose all the more from leakage and evaporation
and so the decision, at some time before 1729, was taken to firmly convert the
area into an excellent meadow.<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">A chapter in milling ends with the last reference to a Dent -
this was on the award map of 1815 where he was assigned tenancy of the track to
the windmill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; There are also <a href="Canal/1811Canal-PondBank.htm">some
maps</a> showing what must be the derelict water-mill of Richard Dent's.&nbsp;
The tenancy of the windmill track was
overlooked in 1919 at the time of the Grafton Estate sale with the result that,
in the 1970s, it was suddenly realised the track was still owned by the current
Duke (or rather, The Earl of Euston).&nbsp; </span>Richard
Dent appears in the 1841 census, aged 70.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
is presumably retired by then because on the Grafton survey map of 1838 it was a
lady <a href="1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_MillField_1838.jpg">known as Ann Westley</a>
(Elizabeth formally) who was in charge of the windmill while her father-in-law
Joseph Westley snr. had a sizeable freeholding off the Stoke Road where he lived
and ran one of the village bakery businesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; This business
he handed to his son Samuel (<a href="1838Maps/MAPS/Blisworth_MillStrip_1838.jpg">see
map</a> - incidentally, 1838 maps of the whole village <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/1838Maps/mapjpg.html">are
available</a>).&nbsp; </span>This was the Joseph Westley that lost his bake house and
dwelling house in the <a href="Greatfire.htm"> great fire</a> of Blisworth in 1798 but he
very quickly
re-established himself.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">Ann Westley was born as Elizabeth Campion, daughter of Robert
Campion who was Constable for the parish and an early member of the <a href="Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm">baptist
movement</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps Elizabeth Campion was an apprentice to Richard Dent
and, with the Duke's approval, became the miller when he retired - no mean feat
for a woman in those times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She married Samuel Westley, son of Joseph Westley (snr), and adopted the name
Ann to perhaps prevent confusion between the many Elizabeths in the family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although no record has yet been found, it has been mentioned by George
Freeston, from a probably un-catalogued document at the Northampton
Record Office, that Ann Westley was acknowledged in charge in 1825.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She certainly was in charge by 1838 being the time of the detailed
Grafton Survey of many parishes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
Richard Rockingham, a miller, also appears in the 1841 census.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was probably in the employ of Ann Westley, as were journeymen
mentioned in later censuses.<o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">Ann Westley's father-in-law,
Joseph snr. married Mary Marriott and came to Blisworth around 1780 from
Piddington.&nbsp; They presumably bought into the land off the Stoke Road, as it
was freeheld in 1757 by someone unknown, and either set up or continued a bakery
business.</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080"><a name="roller"></a>Ann Westley lived at the southern end of South Street that
was adopting its new name of Stoke Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is very likely that she lived <a href="Stokerd02.htm">in Victoria Cottage</a>
(now Victoria House) until she died in 1855.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With Samuel she had a son, Joseph jnr., who became very keen to build up
the milling business whilst retaining the bakery business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Joseph jnr. was born in 1821 and was left with no father in 1832.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
See the passage below that details <a href="mills-blisworth.htm#grave">the grave</a> discovered in
the Baptist Chapel aisle.&nbsp; </span>It was this Joseph, perhaps helped by the clout of his grandfather and
his mother who was clearly an influential lady, who established a steam powered
stone-grinding mill behind the <a href="Earlyindust.htm#bakeh"> Stoke Road bake
house</a> and so stamped the name &quot;Westley&quot; onto the Northamptonshire
milling business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The steam mill was probably operational by 1850 and it can be assumed
that the windmill then fell into disuse and decay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
In 1855 Ann aka Elizabeth Westley died and <a href="mills-blisworth.htm#grave">is also buried</a>
within the Baptist Chapel.&nbsp; Some time later, as Joseph was then in sole
charge of milling in Blisworth, he became dis</span>satisfied with achievements
to date and, in 1877, he travelled to Austria
and Hungary with a
group of 40 millers in the County to learn about the
new technology of steam-powered roller-milling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was then an unfortunate <a href="Blisworth&#32;Mill/millers-fire.htm">fire
at the Stoke Road stone mill in 1879</a> and this spurred Joseph into quickly
establishing at Blisworth <a href="BlisworthMill.htm"> a roller mill</a> on a wharf area by the canal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seems likely that Nunn Mill in Northampton was an operational roller
mill owned by Joseph with his sons by the time of the Blisworth fire so that
there was already the experience for Joseph to quickly build a&nbsp; copy of
Nunn Mill and have it
operational by 1883.<o:p>&nbsp; Interestingly, <a href="Articles/1954-News.htm#foster">an
old villager recalls</a> maintaining some millstone machines at the roller
mill.&nbsp; Evidently these were installed alongside the new roller mills to
service a preference for the traditional product which retains more 'goodness'
than the roller mill flour that offers the baking trade many advantages.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">The cause of the 1879 fire was not
clearly identified.&nbsp; It may be significant that a <a href="Blisworth&#32;Mill/millers-fire.htm">mill-wright
was called in</a> on the day before the night of the fire, for undisclosed
reasons.&nbsp; Interestingly, it appears from the millwright's own records, of repairs etc.
after the fire, that the old windmill on Cliff Hill was refurbished by him to
help with production capacity.</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">Joseph and his wife Elizabeth (m.1847) were good employers,
liberals and benefactors in the village and they were members of the Anglican
church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
probably shook the village by their both turning their back on the Anglican
Church in 1846 and being admitted to the Blisworth Baptist Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
Perhaps they were not impressed by the new rector, <a href="Church/GFChurchnotes.htm"> Rev.
Barry</a>, from 1842.&nbsp; It appears that Joseph had committed himself to </span>financially helping the
<a href="schools.htm"> Anglican school</a> in the village in the purchase of
desks etc. but he found
little in common with the customs (perhaps the 'high church' habits) of the Anglican Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He became an influential figure in the Baptist Church by the time it decided to set
up its own weekend school in 1871.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">Ann Westley's sons, Joseph and his
younger brother Robert, built many
housing units in the village,
notably the <a href="Stokerd02.htm">Westley buildings</a>, which have been said to be for mill
workers though the census data do not confirm this.&nbsp;&nbsp; The houses may have been favoured for those of the Baptist
faith.&nbsp; Another item of local lore is that all the mill workers were of the
Baptist faith.&nbsp; There is <a href="Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm">some evidence for this
from records</a> towards the end of the Victorian era but the well documented class
division of rural life according to Anglican (tradesmen and professionals) vs. Non-conformist
(working class) would generate
such a bias anyway.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Robert became a farmer in Milton.&nbsp; Joseph had eight sons, most of whom moved away or emigrated
to Canada or New Zealand; two died young.&nbsp; The milling business could never
support so many sons but two remained, Alfred and John, to eventually take over
the business.&nbsp; </span>The milling story at
Blisworth begins to wane after Joseph died in 1894.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/download.php?filename=Blisworth%20Mill/Obit%20J%20Westley.pdf">Download here</a> the account
of his tribute and funeral.&nbsp; A modified letter-head for the business after
Joseph died <a href="Blisworth&#32;Mill/letter-head.jpg">is shown here</a>.&nbsp; </span>The Northampton Cooperative Society took over the large mill building at
the wharf in c.1919.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Upon that sale a mill
inventory was made available.&nbsp; The <a href="Blisworth&#32;Mill/mill-inventory.pdf">hand-written
booklet</a> notes articles in different parts of the mill building and certain
assets associated with specific fields in Blisworth parish.&nbsp; </span>However, that
business had failed too by 1930 leaving much unemployment in the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The canal company then acquired the mill building and from then on there
was no milling in Blisworth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
surviving bake house belonging to the Westleys was taken over by <a href="People.htm#sturgess">
the Sturgess’s</a>.<o:p>&nbsp; In their latter years, both Alfred and John
were parish councillors in Blisworth and contributed a number of things we might
forget; the planting of willow trees along the canal bank, the offer of a field
for recreation (<a href="Articles/Fields&amp;Allotments.html">which was turned
down</a>) and the maintenance of
the chapel organ, etc.</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">The Westleys continued in milling using various mills on the
River Nene through Northampton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
were taken over by larger milling concerns as benefits from scaling were being
sought after WW II.<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080"><img height="141" src="Blisworth&#32;Mill/windmill.jpg" width="141" align="left">&nbsp;
In order to clarify one detail,
there is a house on the Stoke Road between Blisworth and Stoke Bruerne called
Windmill Cottage.&nbsp; Although there was a 'windmill' there it was not a mill for
grinding corn.&nbsp; It was built, perhaps no earlier than 1920, to raise water
for the house, being twin cottages in those days, for the farm on the other side
of the road and for stock.&nbsp; The sails drove a long reciprocating shaft
extending to the bottom of a well.&nbsp; There the shaft operated a water
pump.&nbsp; One or two people in the village recall leaping onto the shaft,
hanging on and enjoying the up and down ride!&nbsp; The pump supplied water to a
<a href="Blisworth&#32;Mill/windmill-cotts-sm.jpg">header tank</a> that was place
on elevated ground beside the tunnel ventilator shaft nearby.&nbsp; This photograph is dated
1935, taken from the Stoke Rd. facing Blisworth.</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">Of the corn milling in the
village, very little remains.&nbsp; There are large round millstones in a
couple of gardens which would date back to c.1880 if they were retrieved from the fire
damaged premises in Stoke Road; no provenance is available.</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:4.0pt"><font color="#000080">Finally a note about the two other
booklets that refer to Blisworth milling.&nbsp; Mona
Clinch's book (1938) has some inaccuracies regarding the use of the windmill
and the timing of the closure of the water mill.&nbsp; That part of <a href="Personalities/memories-clinch.htm">the
book reproduced here</a> carries appropriate corrections.&nbsp; Jane Evan's book (2003)
that was commissioned by a member of the Westley family aims to cover not only
early Blisworth milling history but also the 20th century story of Westley mills in
Northamptonshire and their eventual absorption into other competing
companies.&nbsp; There is no contention regarding the latter aim (which has not
been looked into) but, unfortunately, the details of the Blisworth story, on
both mills and family, are faulty in numerous instances, too numerous to list here.&nbsp;
One or
two instances spring from a reading of Clinch.&nbsp;
There are only a few copies of the book in circulation - nevertheless here is
the warning that this author considers it not wise consulting <u>for Blisworth
details.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

on the Westley family:&nbsp;</b> We
are fortunate that in late 2009 the Deacons of the Baptist Chapel had decided on a
general refurbishment of the building.&nbsp; The entrance porch was brightened

in the middle of the left aisle was found the grave stone of Samuel Westley and
Ann aka Elizabeth Westley, the parents of the entrepreneur Joseph Westley.&nbsp;
Below are the two photos we could take of the grave before being again covered
by carpet.&nbsp; Note that it is now obvious that both parents of Joseph were
Baptists while we know that Joseph himself began with the Anglican Church,
