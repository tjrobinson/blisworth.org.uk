<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a href="Churchbells.htm"><font color="#FF0000">Back to the bells restoration
section</font></a></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font color="#000080">There appears to have been a complete
overhaul of the bell frame and the bells in 1624, which date appears on one of
the massive oaken beams now supporting (rather precariously) the frame on which
our present five bells hang. At that time, 1624, the second and third bells were
most probably added, for both these bells are inscribed with the date 1624.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 1626 the smallest bell was recast, and yet again in 1758. Number 4 bell
was recast in 1758 and number 5 bell, our largest at 42” diameter, was recast
in 1663 and again in 1758. In 1700 it is recorded that there was a Priest’s
bell which carried the date 1635 but no mention of this bell appears at a later
date.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>[recorded in the churchwardens account book is an
expenditure of £94 to J. Taylor and Company to repair a cracked fourth bell]</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">All five bells carry interesting inscriptions. Since the early days the
custom of inscribing the church bells seems to have been fairly common, although
the pre-Reformation bells carried the simple name of a saint and perhaps the
name of the founder. These early inscriptions are usually in stately Gothic
capitals and in Latin - the language of the medieval church. The Reformation
introduced many changes in connection with bells. The capitals gradually gave
way to clumsy Roman letters for the inscriptions. English, although it did not
supplant Latin, gained a full share of use on the bells. The old forms gave
place to mottos of a reverent character which soon, however drifted in many
places into doggerel rhyme, stupid, frivolous and thoroughly out of place or
into a bare list of names of vicars and churchwardens.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Following are the inscriptions on our five bells:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bell 1, “TINNITVS RAPIDOS SCINT ILLANS SPARGO PER AVRAS”</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Translates: Sparkling scatter through the air with rapid sounds.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THOS AEYRE ME FECIT 1756</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Bell 2, BARTHOLEMEW ATTON MADE ME 1624 RA</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bell 3, BARTHOLEMEW ATTON MADE ME RA 1624</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bell 4, “GOD SAVE OUR QVEEN AND PRESARVE HER PECE”</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080">Bell 5, “VLTERA CVRETVM PLVUSVS CORYBANTUAQVE AERA”</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Translates: beyond the applause of the Curetes, and the cymbals of Corybantes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Henry Bagly made me 1663.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000080">________________________________________________________</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bell 1 was cast in the reign of George II, bells 2 and 3 in the reign of
James I and bell 4 in the reign of Queen Anne.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bell 1, up to the beginning of WW II, was rung daily at twelve noon and was
commonly called the “Dinner Bell”, thanks to the sexton’s good time
keeping. This practice was very welcome in the days before radio and time
signals.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The bell 5 inscription calls for some explanation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
Cretan mythology the Curetes were demi-gods armed with weapons of brass, to whom
the new born child Zeus was given for safe keeping. They drowned his cries by
striking their spears against their shields. The Corebantes were the mythical
attendants of the Phrygian goddess Phea Cybelle, who was supposed to accompany
the goddess with wild dances and intoxicating music while she wandered by
torchlight over the forest-clad mountains.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Both bells 1 and 5 were cast by bell founder Thos. Aeyre, of Kettering, and
he probably had stock (meaningless?) phrases to be applied to his bells. Many
founders incl. Aeyre were also clockmakers - hence Horologicus after his name.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Mention of Bartholemew Atton, the founder of bells 2 and 3, is first made at
Buckingham in 1604. The latest dated bells by this man are our own in Blisworth.
Little otherwise is known of this founder.&nbsp; (That was the case in 1965 but when
Phil Cahill and his team organised the <a href="Churchbells.htm">refurbishment
of the bells</a>, Barbara Atton, the founder's descendant, (photo below) came to visit
as they were taking down the bells.&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been doing a lot of research on Bartholomew and is more than willing to part with any information
required.&nbsp; Any interest will be passed on through this website.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Bell 4, together with its quaint spelling of the inscription, was the product
of Henry Bagly of Chacombe near Banbury. Chacombe was a forest village, hence
the good supply of timber to melt the bronze. A member of the Bagly family also
advertised: “..the said Henry Bagly if desired will cast any ring or rings of
bells in the town where they belong..” The practice was common of casting and
tuning bells in a workshop set up in the churchyard. The roads were in such a
bad condition that they prohibited the cartage of such heavy objects for any
great distance.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">From the earliest of times bells were christened, but from the time of the
reformation such christening got a little out of hand. Gilbert White tells of
when the new bells were brought to Selbourne, the treble bell was fixed upside
down and filled with punch. This form of profane christening has fortunately
become a thing of the past and dedications have taken their place.</font></p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 50"><font color="#000080">The English have for so many generations enthusiastically practiced bell
ringing that long ago we became known to our overseas visitors as the “Ringing
Island”. There are recorded cases, however, where ringing of bells was not
always acceptable. In one case the town stated that bell ringing turned all
drink sour.<br>
