<b>Edwin
Whitlock</b> was born
on the 30<sup>th</sup> June 1900, in the village of Blisworth in
Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Ted, son of William (or &quot;Witty&quot; as he was known in
Blisworth), was the third of four brothers. His father
was the village undertaker and intended to train Ted to assist him in the
business. He became a good carpenter and made many excellent coffins, but he
couldn’t bear filling ‘em, and soon opted out. He tried several other jobs
before finally settling in the motor trade, where he became an expert at fitting
solid tyres on motor car wheels.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">The seemingly
minor incident which was to be instrumental in bringing him to Kent,
and in fact which affected the rest of his life, occurred during the First World
War.&nbsp; At the age of 17, in 1917, he joined the Army in Northampton, and found
himself in the Kings Royal Rifles. After some initial training he was
transferred to Colchester, where he found that a new Colonel had just arrived to
take over the battalion there. A few days later a notice appeared on the
Battalion notice-board that volunteers were required for batman to the new CO.
Ted put his name forward and soon found himself in a queue waiting to be
interviewed.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">At last, it was his turn –
<b> “SHUN”</b>, screamed the Sergeant
Major, <b> “RIEEEGHT TURN - - QUICK MERCH</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>EP IGHT EP IGHT EP IGHT ALT. RIGHT TURN,
STAN STILL</b>”.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">“<b>Where do
you come from, boy?</b>” bellowed the figure in front of him.<br>
“<b>Er – if you please Sir, Blisworth, Sir</b>”, as if Blisworth was as big as
London.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">“<b>Blisworth?
Then you must know me. I live at Stoke Bruerne Park</b>”<br>
“<b>Stoke Bruerne Park, Sir?</b>” “<b>Colonel Vernon Sir?</b>”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">At last Ted
had nerve enough to lower his eyes and look at the man.<br>
With the ghost of a smile he said,</font></span> <font color="#000080"> <span lang="EN-US">“<b>Yes Sir, I
remember, Sir</b>”</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">“<b>And are
you prepared to be my batman?</b>”<br>
</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">“<b>Very well.

that. </span>

persisted for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted remained the
Colonel’s batman until he was de-mobbed in 1921 and then went home to Blisworth.
There he was found two days later by Mrs. Vernon.&nbsp; She had driven over in a pony
and trap, and asked Ted to drive her to Aldershot in, of all things, a Model T
Ford. There he was met by the now General Vernon and agreed to become his
chauffeur and valet for £1 a week.&nbsp; From Aldershot they moved several times in
the next few years, and whilst at an address in Englefield Green in Surrey, Ted,
in true “Upstairs/Downstairs” fashion, fell in love with and married the
housemaid, Miss Edith Mills.&nbsp; Eventually General Vernon retired and in 1932
they came to Eyhorne Street. Ted, now a full-blown chauffeur since they had three
cars, received £2-10-0 a week and lived in one of the cottages that now comprise
Eyhorne Manor.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">He joined the
Territorial Army and was called up in 1939. He was off to France in 1940 and he spent a
very unhappy couple of days on the beaches at Dunkirk.&nbsp; He eventually arrived
back safely, promoted by now to Staff Sergeant.&nbsp; The division regrouped at
Pontefract, thence to Africa, El Alamein, Tripoli, Tunis, Salerno and Naples.
There they were pulled out of the line, rested and returned to Tripoli whence
they made a very hazardous journey lasting two months to get home by troop-ship.
And it weren’t ‘alf hot Mum!&nbsp; Thereafter they regrouped at RASC,
Godmersham Park, thence to Dereham, Norfolk and embarked at Tilbury for France
on “D” plus 6.&nbsp; Slowly they fought their way across Europe, until they
reached Hamburg, where they were thankful to receive the news that hostilities
had ceased.&nbsp; Eventually, events taking their formal course, Ted found
himself at Guildford where he was demobbed for a second time. Then he was back to Hollingbourne
to find himself out of a job. General Vernon had died and Mrs. Vernon had moved
to Winchester.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">However, his
earlier work stood him in good stead and he was able to get a very good job with
Ansteys who were then the Austin Distributors for Kent which was where he stayed
until he retired in 1967. He and his wife enjoyed 14 years of retirement until
she died in 1981.&nbsp;<o:p> Edwin Whitlock was deeply involved in the local
affairs over
a considerable period.&nbsp; He has been; Parish clerk for 26 years at
Hollingbourne,
Special Constable and Special Sergeant in the Kent County Constabulary for 15 years, member of the British Legion, successful exhibitor
of the Garden Society and leader of the Darby and Joan Club from 1975
to 1983.&nbsp; He died in 1990.</o:p>
