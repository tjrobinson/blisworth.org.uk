        called Connegar Leys (note the houses in the background).&nbsp; The large gardens in the
        middle of the ring were then considered as valuable housing land by the 1960/70s and two
        of the 1938 houses, numbers 60 and 62, were demolished to make room for
        an access road to a new road called Greenaway Close.</td>

        Victorian picture was brought over by a couple from Australia and shown
        to George Freeston.&nbsp; It shows a view of the High Street* with
        numbers 23 and 25 (1952 numbering) on the south side of the street and a
        view right through to the church and the rectory (1842).&nbsp; What is
        missing is the 1875 block of three houses known as &quot;The
        Gables&quot; (nos. 27, 29 and 31) at the corner with the road known now
        as Church Lane.&nbsp; The artist has incorporated the elm trees that
        once stood in the churchyard but placed them behind the rectory for
        better artistic appeal.
        <p>The untidy ramps up to the cottages, which are exaggerated, show that
        the land slopes across the street, high on the left and low to right all
        the way down to Pond bank.&nbsp; Ramp-ways still exist today.
