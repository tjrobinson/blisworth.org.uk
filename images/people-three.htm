      born in Stoke Bruerne in 1885, daughter of Thomas Amos ropemaker.&nbsp;
      She married Chas. Ward (date not known) who became eventually the village
      ropemaker after Mr. Amos died.&nbsp; Mary travelled to Europe and stayed
      at many hostels and covents where she learnt a considerable body of
      medical knowledge as an assistant nurse.&nbsp; She began as a nurse and midwife for the families on narrow
        boats in the 1920's and, as they now say, won their hearts and minds.&nbsp; She became an employee of the Grand Union and
        Associated Canal Carrying Companies who readily saw the advantage of
      having her skills.&nbsp; She retired in 1962 but continued to help the women of families on narrow boats for no payment
        or salary in return.&nbsp; She frequently encountered doctors such as
      Derek Bull who generally came to respect her skills.&nbsp; She was awarded
      the British Empire Medal in c1985 for services to the public.</td>
