        &nbsp;<b>Navigation Inn</b>&nbsp; The Inn was built at the time of the canal,
        1806, once it was known this location would have the link to
        Northampton, first by horse rail but upgraded to a flight of locks by
        1815.&nbsp; A picture dated 1926 is <a href="Villages/navigation,1926sm.jpg">shown

        The map segment below shows that the tenant of the Inn, probably the
        first 'landlord', and the
        surrounding fields was a John Dix in c.1825 when it is believed this
        pocket map was drawn.&nbsp; The map shows interesting features: a
        pencilled indication of the <a href="Railways/Npton-vind.htm">new
        railway and its suggested branch</a>  (1830?) and the name of the place -
        &quot;Northampton Arm&quot;, <i> please note all boaters</i>.&nbsp;
        There is also a &quot;C. J. Co&quot; label where the canal
        company had and still has its depot and wharf.
        <p><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;It also shows odd spur of
        canal running to the north of what is now Gayton Marina, labeled field
        925 in the map.&nbsp; This spur was very probably there to link
        with the </font><font color="#0000FF"> <a href="Canal/horse_rail_wharf.htm"> horse rail line</a></font>.</p>
        <p>Note there is a label on some neighbouring fields - &quot;Thomas Westley&quot; with the &quot;t&quot; crossed out.&nbsp; He
        and his father and grandfather, from Tiffield, <u>were</u> known as
        Wesleys but were in fact ultimately related to the Westleys from
        Piddington that gave us <a href="mills-blisworth.htm">Joseph junior</a>.<br>
