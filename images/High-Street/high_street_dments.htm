        <p><font SIZE="3"><font color="#000080">The <a href="../Greatfire.htm">
        Great Fire of Blisworth</a> in 1798 destroyed at least two buildings divided
        into dwellings and various barns in the High Street between what is now
        number 23 and a farmhouse building which later became the Post Office (<a href="../Articles/post_office_services.htm#post">in its
        second village location</a> c1900) on the corner with the Stoke Road. Although
        that
        corner farmhouse was rebuilt and the building across the road (Crieff House)
        was
        repaired minus one wing, the other damaged buildings were neglected
        for many years.&nbsp; There are maps of the south side of the High
        Street in the article on the Great Fire.&nbsp; In the Grafton survey of 1839, part of the area was
        still described as being in ruins. In 1845 an application was made to
        the Council for Education to erect a Church of England school extension on a site behind
        a barn next to number 23. Provision was to be made to share the cesspool
        facilities with number 23!&nbsp; The Church of England school, in the Stoke
        Road, that was tardily rebuilt in 1815, after the 1798 fire, was presumably becoming
        crowded and the extension would have probably been for the infants. The
        land belonged to the 5th Duke of Grafton.&nbsp; He was in his first year
        as Duke and presumably the villagers had no previous experience of his
        views.&nbsp; Unfortunately the Duke was fanatical about church-going and
        aspects of religious
        education and wrote his objections to the proposed management of the
        school in that one person, the Rev. William
        Barry, should share responsibility for the education of the children
        with all ratepayers in the village. The Duke's objection was unacceptable to the council
        who
        therefore refused the
        financial grant to build the school extension. So the Duke withdrew his offer of
        land.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Because of the railway, the 1850’s saw much expansion in the
        village. The <a href="../schools.htm#building"> Stoke Road school</a> was eventually enlarged in 1861, probably
        with a second storey to present the familiar elevation, which came
        nearer to the road with a large gable window.&nbsp; The building would be recognisable as
        our Village Hall.&nbsp; The village also saw much building by the Grafton Estate in
        the 1860’s in the form of &quot;Grafton-style&quot; cottages for
        villagers.&nbsp; A cluster of three cottages were built in the High
        Street, numbers 27, 29 and 31, at the Church Lane turn and two of these <a href="../New&#32;Houses/ChurchLane/Church&#32;Lane.htm">
        have been recently refurbished</a>.&nbsp; The style was very popular with
        the Duchess and can be found in many villages within the old
        estate.&nbsp; Eventually, on the site next to number 23, a new house was
        built which incorporated, at its western end, the <a href="../people-three.htm#matilda"> village Post Office,
        in its first location</a>. By the way, the house was subsequently divided into
        two parts and later recombined.&nbsp; When all the house numbers were allocated
        in 1952 it was assigned number 21 but the house now stands, again
        divided, as numbers 21 and 21a.&nbsp; Further up the High St was to be the site of a new brick built shop with
        outbuildings.&nbsp; In this instance the Duke sold the land in 1866 to the Northampton Progressionist
        Society (a forerunner of the Northampton “Co-op”).&nbsp; The shop was set well back
        and given <a href="../Shop.htm#young"> brick wings extending to the road edge</a> to provide 'off-road
        parking' for delivery horse and carts. This is evident in archive postcards
        we have. The Progressionists offered a grocery and general store but
        unfortunately the business enterprise fractured and folded in 1871 due
        to arguments over suspected corruption and the shop was then sold to
        Walter Young, son of a farmer from Roade. The Young family continued
        with the general store business until 1983 when the Hensons took over
        and built an extension to the shop to house the present Post Office.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">As village population continued to rise, by 1874 the school
        eventually obtained another extension. It was built on the opposite side of
        the Stoke Road in the form of a single-storey building that is now number 6. The
        extension was definitely for infants that time and was put through
        without difficulty - by then, they were dealing with the 6th Duke! As
        education moved to pastures new in 1913, the Stoke Road school was
        closed and the infant school was used as a working man’s institute -
        known as <a href="../Articles/village_hall.htm#stute"> &quot;The Stute”</a>
        between the wars.&nbsp; By 1946 it had been used by army cadets and was
        in a sad state.&nbsp; It was subsequently <a href="../MiscPlaces-two.htm#stute"> sold by the parish
        council</a>,
        having been a gift from the church at some time, to a member of the
        Freeston family.&nbsp; The money raised eventually found its way into the project
        to convert the Stoke Road school into a new village hall.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">There was still a gap between Young’s shop and the shop,
        now a private dwelling, on the
        Stoke Road corner. Some of this space was used to accommodate a <a href="../TheCross.htm#fire"> mail
        sorting office</a> that was located in Blisworth because of <a href="../Lyrical/edgar-ayres.htm">mail
        deliveries</a> at the railway embankment. The
        remainder was part of Walter Chester’s wheelwright yard later to
        accommodate Edwin Freeston’s motor garage business. That gap still seems to
        remain and presents a somewhat &quot;unfinished&quot; and disowned look
        from the street.</font></p>
