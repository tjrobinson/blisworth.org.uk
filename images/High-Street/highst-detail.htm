        were once subdivided were set as one continuous row.<p align="left">The
        bakehouse is that identified in c. 1700.&nbsp; John Staughton (Stalton) is recorded a
        farmer in the <a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm#1">1727 Grafton
        Survey</a> and a baker in his 1701 <a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm#certify">certification</a>
        to use his house as a baptist meeting house.&nbsp; The site of the

        number 40 decided to take down a part of their house in order to gain
        direct access to their rear garden.&nbsp; Up till then they had to go
        around the back of number 38.&nbsp; At this stage one can see the
        disused bedroom door.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The front door had steps which frequently
        &quot;provided a good trip back from the Royal Oak&quot; but it was
        converted to a window and a front door was grafted onto the new end of
        the house - see next picture.</p>

        their thatch roof with tiles.&nbsp; This was in response to the fire at
        the Royal Oak which demonstrated how a fire can be hard to control - see
        High Street, Part II.
        <p>Another minor refinement involved having the advert for stout removed
        from the end wall.&nbsp; The village was adorned with various signs of
        this sort - this one provided hardly enough income per year to purchase
        a small crate of favourite beer!</td>

        wall at number 38, facing number 40.&nbsp; Although the arch is only
        about 5 foot high, the indications are that there was communication
        between the two parts.&nbsp; On the number 40 side there was a
        substantial hollow in which there fitted a cupboard.&nbsp; This picture
        shows the hollow more-or-less filled up with new brickwork.&nbsp; The
        wall has been subsequently rendered and the owner is not at all happy
        with the idea that the archway might be of sufficient interest to
        warrant an investigation.</td>

        window on the same wall, situated halfway into the garret, shows that
        whilst the gable end of No 38 stood, there was at some time no upper
        floor in the building at No 40.&nbsp; Perhaps 'No 40' was merely an
        extension to No 38 with access via a low archway.&nbsp; Could the
        extension have been a significant part of John Staughton's bakery -
        perhaps a shop?&nbsp; Or maybe part of his Baptists involvement -
        perhaps a meeting place?&nbsp; See footnote 1 of the article &quot;<a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm">Baptists
