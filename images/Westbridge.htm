        award map.&nbsp; The mill at the bridge, indicated by the pink square
        was not built until 1879.&nbsp; Earlier than that, c. 1865, the High
        Street was straightened as shown by the pink lines, the bridge over the
        canal then consisted of two bridges in one; a humpbacked bridge dating
        from c. 1800 and a flat bridge based on a network of rolled steel girders.&nbsp; There was
        originally a large yard in front of the <a href="West&#32;Bridge/Grafton&#32;House/Grafton&#32;House.htm"> Grafton Arms</a> but this was tidied up
        to leave a triangle of land shown as green (now it is grass but for many
        years it was a dump for road mending materials too)&nbsp; The small
        house marked where the triangle is was the house and shop of the foreman of the
        wharves - the &quot;Wharfinger&quot; - a Mr Thomas Goode at the time
        with <a href="whitlock.htm">John Whitlock son-in-law and lodger, father
        of &quot;Witty&quot;</a>.

        maps</a> of similar vintage which raises interesting questions regarding
        the wharfs. 
        <p align="left">Most of the pictures which follow were taken in 1956/7 at the
        time of the renewal of the steelwork of the 1865 bridge. </td>
