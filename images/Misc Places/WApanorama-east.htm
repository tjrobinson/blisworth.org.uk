Panorama by Walter Alexander.&nbsp; Taken from the field next to the Gayton
Road, c.1960.&nbsp; There is a wave<br>
in the horizon line which we must not complain about!&nbsp; The canal runs along
the bottom of the field.&nbsp; On the<br>
other side of the canal is the field called Pond Bank which runs up to a small
paddock behind the Royal Oak<br>
pub.&nbsp; The sloped part of the field was an excellent tobogganing place
before our road called Westbrook was<br>
established there in the 1970s. </p>
