Panorama by Walter Alexander.&nbsp; Taken from the corner of Connegar Leys, c.
1965.&nbsp; The first six buildings<br>
from the left are all situated on the Stoke Road.&nbsp; When Home Farm was
demolished, Buttmead started at the<br>
farm house and ended at the position of the camera.&nbsp; The field in the
foreground was converted to Windmill<br>
Avenue and Wellspring.&nbsp; The field by the farm was converted by Wilson's to
Eastfield and Home Close and<br>
the field to the right of that, on the other side of the splendid hedge, gave
way to extensions to those two roads<br>
by K G Lawrence.&nbsp; Footpath RD2 still crosses the area, running immediately
on the nearside of the field<br>
boundary, and can be found on the oldest maps of the village dating from the
beginning of the 18th century.&nbsp; </p>
