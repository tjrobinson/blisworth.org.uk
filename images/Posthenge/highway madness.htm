        in the mists of the 1960s an overworked architect laid out the K. G. Laurence
        and Wilson housing estates that were to fill the space between the Stoke
        Road and Connegar Leys. The housing was considered to conform to
        &quot;budget&quot; and to cater for a wide range of families so there were
        included both detached, semi-detached and terraced houses and quite a
        few semi-detached bungalows, also a small number of detached bungalows. In a number of cases, especially
        for some
        bungalows and some terraced houses, a garage for the residents was
        included in a group of garages at some small distance. In one case,
        there was provided room for the garage and there was a short drive and
        kerbstone dropdown (drop-kerb) but the provision of the garage was left for an
        incoming owner to provide. This was probably a feature that was
        attractive to a few not-so-well-off or retired folk, at least that was
        the case in the 1960s but such a provision nowadays would be considered
        anachronistic.</span></font><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"></o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="high-st-aerial.jpg" width="950" height="325">
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The image on the left, above,
        shows the lower 200 yard section of Buttmead, as it was in ~1970.&nbsp;
        The image on the right gives more detail so that access provision for
        each of these four bungalows can be viewed reasonably clearly.&nbsp; The
        bungalow to the left has a twin strip of concrete to serve as a drive
        and a drop-kerb on Eastfield (as in the view
        in the left-hand image). There is no garage but there is room for one
        behind the house. The next three bungalows just had a single strip of
        concrete to serve as a path to the house and no provision of a drop-kerb.
        Instead there is a grouping of three
        spaces for cars around the corner to the right and two have been laid to
        concrete but one has not. One of the owners had erected a single garage
        right next door to the first (detached) bungalow on Buttmead.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Now
        fast-forward to the new millenium; the two middle bungalows have
        extensive pavoired areas and have been parking near their bungalows for
        years, apparently.&nbsp; They have no drop-kerb because there is an obstacle in the way:
        there is an
        intervening &quot;half-moon&quot; of grass (this is visible only in the
        left-hand image whilst the right hand image was originally cropped that way and does
        not include this grass). </font>
        <span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Along
        comes a <b> NCC</b> Highways team and within one day in October 2012
        seventeen heavy posts
        are planted across the half-moon of grass. The official <b>NCC</b> view of
        the situation, at the
        outset, is that the posts were needed to deal with two issues: (i) the grass
        was being/had been parked
        upon despite the area being a 'visibility splay' and (ii) the pavement
        was being driven across. In the absence of a
        drop-kerb it is illegal to drive <u> across</u> a pavement. Given a
        drop-kerb it is legal to drive right across the part that is a
        pedestrian way leaving no part of the vehicle across that way, and not
        driving in a way liable to endanger the public. The official view of the
        use of 'driveways' without drop-kerbs may have been more flexible many
        years ago and an impression of this may have persisted until more
        recently.</span></font></span>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">The picture below aims to
        show <b>NCC</b> Highways' creation in wood in as attractive a light as possible but the sad
        truth, one feels, is that the posts are an abomination, a vulgar
        signature of our urban society and thoroughly unwelcome at that. But the
        creation is a result of cavalier elements in society, both in relation
        to individuals and institutions, and one wonders why the product of the
        altercation has to
        be a physical one - oh well!</span></font></span>

      <font color="#000080">In principle the illegality could be removed by
        altering the layout of this part of the street so that a drop-kerb could
        be incorporated. Evidently there would be problems over this because (i)
        the grass has certain undisclosed services under it and (ii) any drop-kerb
        would be too near to the junction with Eastfield because, in general,
        the policy is to allow 10 metres between any drop-kerb and a junction
      (though, years ago, that policy might have been significantly more
      flexible).&nbsp; So these posts, our own &quot;Post-henge&quot;, stay for
        the duration to render the area safe to pedestrians, except in the dark
        perhaps; those shin-high edges look a bit unforgiving.&nbsp; Maybe we
        could get together and decorate the Post-henge with some low bushes;
        even as few as 3 or 4 pretty bushes would soften the present impression
      so that it might look less like an approach to an array of street-<b>ATM</b>s.
      The Parish Council was however dead against this idea as there would have
      been an unacceptable duty of maintenance.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">On reading this
        article one may wonder why it is included in an 'on-going' history
        archive. The reason is that the Post-henge may well be a feature of
        Blisworth that is left in place long after (i). rules or methods have
        changed or (ii). the initiators have moved away or passed on. In regard
        to the second contingency, &quot;the posts are permanent&quot;, says the
        <b>NCC, </b>their action evidently being to preserve what is 'highway'
        for all time.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>May 1st, 2013</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Just about six months after placing the posts, with the rider &quot;for
        all time...&quot;, NCC Highways removed them and set the area to
        grass.&nbsp; The comments later suggested that it had become well known
        the posts were &quot;not working&quot; and that other methods should be
        explored.</font>

        <p><font color="#000080"><b>November 13th, 2014</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; With some
        newcomers in the next door to end bungalow, a recent application for a driveway and drop-kerb
        was evidently received without objection despite being at the junction
        of roads, so the corner
        now has a new look (see inset). This is to be applauded for it now seems that
        reasonable modernisation of vehicular provisions <i> is</i> allowed and all of
        us on this 1960s estate may enjoy the &quot;new forward looking&quot; Highways
        Dept rules.</font></p>
