         adopted by the N.C.C. until 1967.&nbsp; There was a flurry of concern
         as to the naming of the road once it was to be adopted (May
         1967).&nbsp; In an insane move, the Parish Council suggested calling
         the part of the road nearest to Blisworth Arm by the old name of Ford
         Lane and the remaining part to the Grafton Villas as Station Road.&nbsp; The council subsequently realised the error made by
         the council clerk, guess who (!), in that if there were to be two names
         they should surely be applied the other way around.&nbsp; The N.C.C.
         lost patience at that point and decreed an end to the nonsense - the
         name of the entire road would stay as Station Road.&nbsp; The records
         associated with the renaming and numbering of all houses in the Parish
         (1952) suggest that Ford Lane and possibly also Station Road were in
         use (inconsistently?) before 1952 - the action then being to help the
         postal services and utilities companies out of their confusion.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>27-24&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; The SMJ line, or rather the
        cutting for it, has been tidied up to form a &quot;pocket park&quot; as
        it passes through Tiffield Parish.&nbsp; Nearer to Blisworth station,
        the cutting is crossed by many fallen trees.&nbsp; The section, which is
        mostly on an embankment, starting at the location of the picture above,
        has been used as a dog-walk until very recently (Sept 2005) - that is until the
        fact it is on privately owned land has been pointed out with notices.</p>
        <p align="left">The bridge shown here carries the back road to Gayton,
        over the SMJ line, adjacent to where it joins the Tiffield road from
        Blisworth.&nbsp; A wooden stairs provides access from the road.&nbsp; In
        places, the cutting is very deep and a haven for rabbits.&nbsp; There is
        some local lore about the railway drivers being <a href="Railways/tales_of_rabbit_hunting.htm">keen
        on those rabbits</a>.</p>
