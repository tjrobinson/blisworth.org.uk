        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        <p align="left">This view of the bridge over the Grand Union Canal was
        incorporated in the Grafton Estate sale catalogue of 1919.&nbsp; The bridge was
        eventually taken down in about 1930 after many complaints about its
        safety.&nbsp; The canal-side opposite the towpath was a wharf not only
        for ironstone but also limestone.&nbsp; The path taken by the limestone railway down to
        the wharf
        this side of the bridge, to the right of the canal, can be easily made
        out though the rails themselves, which should be there, are not clear.&nbsp; The limestone track
        was probably taken up in the 1920's after the Hunsbury iron furnaces
        were closed. </td>

        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>17-02&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></center>This picture taken by the GJC Chief Engineer is of
        interest for three reasons.&nbsp; Obviously it shows a canal incident
        (see the <a href="Canalone.htm"> canal pages</a>) but in the background there is the ironstone
        bridge.&nbsp; Some details of the wagon tipping mechanism is evident.&nbsp;
        On the bank are some limestone wagons from the nearby opencast quarry
        (even older than the ironstone workings).&nbsp; The wagons open at their
        sides so that limestone can be chuted into waiting narrow boats (see
        image number <a href="Canalone.htm">08-04</a>).&nbsp;
        Note that the wagons have a breadth perhaps twice that of the rail
        track.</p>
        <p align="left">Unusually, not only a high quality print but also a
        glass 'whole plate', <u>original negative</u>, resides in the
        Northampton Record Office, G Freeston box 1996/Limestone.&nbsp; Offices
        at Blisworth Arm Wharf were in the process of being demolished when G
        Freeston pointed out there was material which should be saved.&nbsp;
        Much of the Canal Collection at the NRO was rescued by G Freeston at
        that time but this picture has not yet been transferred to it.</p>

        <p>Despite safety concerns the photographer stood in the middle of the
        bridge to record Bill Freeston with his fiancee walking back up towards
        the bridge under the Stoke Road.&nbsp; At about this time, c. 1930,
        there remained on the bridge a single wagon that was left at the close
        of ironstone mining business in 1921.&nbsp; The workers arrived one
        morning to discover the gates locked.&nbsp; It was a feature of the
        hoist system that always left a wagon, or group of wagons, on the
        bridge.&nbsp; A rare photo of the last
        wagon, which may have been taken by Walter Alexander, is <a href="Ironstone-Bridge/wagon-bridge.jpg">shown
        here</a>.</p>

        canal milestone (&quot;Braunston 18 miles&quot; is presently written on a modern
        re-incarnation of the milestone) from which anyone today can work out exactly where the

        and the appearance of the telephone posts this picture is dated around
        1930s.&nbsp; It provides a good view of the massive timbers that
        supported the off-side end of the bridge which appears to have <a href="Ironstone-Bridge/wagon-bridge.jpg"> the last
        wagon</a> still mounted on it but shifted towards the end.&nbsp; The
        limestone chute, made of timber, has been cleared away.

        <p>This picture comes from Rod Warner (via the Pictures of England
        website) and shows the scene from above at a stage a few years
        earlier.&nbsp; Estimating the date of this picture at 1885 suggests the
        lady may be the wife of the new rector Henry Thomas Barry (Rector: 1884
        - 1904) as the gate from their gardens is just a short distance further
        on the towpath.&nbsp; The picture is from an album it seems.</p>
