        a careful comparison of maps, using graphics software that allows one to
        precisely 'drape' an old map onto a modern OS derivative, one can begin
        to construct past detail simply from such things as the outline of
        fields. The first on this page, covers the northern part of the parish,
        and is the result of draping a 1727 Grafton
        survey map over OS 1970 which retains many old field boundaries but
        omits the bypass.&nbsp; All the blue labelling are 'hot links' to short pieces
        of text below. In that text will be found further links to some detail placed
        elsewhere
        on the website.&nbsp; I regard this exercise as an improvement process
        for some less detailed work presented on the website. The second map, at almost the same
        scale, deals with the south half of the parish. Here there is far more scope for map fitting
        than in the case of the northern half. Until I can delete some cruder or
        less helpful bits on other pages the user might find some repetition.
        Doing this work has become a hobby - I hope you will be able to bear
        with me!<br>

        Field</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; The extent of the feudal
        North Field is shown in peach/pink colour. From 1940s aerial photographs
        taken by the RAF there was much evidence of ridge &amp; furrow
        patterning, the extent of the more obvious being the area shaded pink
        rather than peach which in fact extends into Milton Parish a little
        further than Barn Lane. It is not clear where, in the west, North Field
        gives way to Wood Field and, as there is no evidence of ridge and furrow
        patterning in the south-east, it may be that those higher lands were
        used for stock rather than strip cultivation ie. were always inclosed.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="stream"></a>Mill-stream</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The stream runs across a slowly descending plain towards Lady Bridge,
        skirting the sand bank on which Milton Malsor (Middle Town) is perched.
        This stream was <a href="../Sanitation/sewage-water.htm"> Blisworth's open sewer</a> until replaced by a culvert in the
        1920s. Ridge &amp; Furrow patterning show that many peasant farmers had
        the benefit of a stream at one end of some of their strips and in a 18C
        Court &amp; Leet memo, farmers are instructed to keep their length of
        mill-stream clear for the stream flow.&nbsp;This would have applied only
        to strips north of the Drift in 18C as that was still not inclosed.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#000080"><a name="drift"></a></font><font color="#0000FF">The
        Drift</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; This feature is marked on
        only one map drawn by the railway surveyors. It represents where the
        line of the stream became ill defined and where rubbish carried by the
        stream would be inclined to come to rest. Railway engineers in the 1830s
        circumscribed the drift area with two fresh channels and two 30&quot;
        culverts which passed under the railway embankment. The western culvert
        is still used by the stream while the eastern one has been appropriated
        for sewage.&nbsp; In pre-inclosure times (before 1649 or maybe a very
        much earlier date) the mill-stream
        would have cut a steady descent and there would have been no drift. Once
        the fields in the first inclosure were establish, the farmers would have
        cut the course for the stream deeper in order to fence with efficiency
        at its banks. Consequently, on emergence of the stream from the inclosed
        area, the stream would have attained a level that was too low for its
        surroundings and the speed of the water would have decreased markedly
        and, over the years, would have created the drift.</font></p>

        in <a href="../Development/Greenlane/medieval&#32;lane.htm"> a separate
        document</a>, discovered rather belatedly (March 2013)
        displayed in
        the <a href="../Tunnel&#32;Toll/tunneltoll.htm">map dealing with the
        tunnel and toll road</a> over Blisworth Hill that has been posted on

        Lownes</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; There are various
        spellings: <a href="../Loundes/naming_lowndes.htm">Lound, Lownde, Loune</a>. the first of these has been identified
        as of Old Norse origin and means <i>Grove</i> whilst in 20C Yorkshire
        dialect (Viking related possibly) the word means <i>Calm</i>.&nbsp;
        Fields on both sides of the parish boundary with Gayton have Lownde
        names and the whole area <a href="../loundes.htm"> includes a rather remote and miniature valley</a>
        fed by a spring. It is tempting to regard the area, along with the
        rising land up to the site of the Roman Villa, as that of a settlement
        in <a href="../Farming/Fields/cropmarks.htm"> pre-medieval times</a> (no historic evidence of deserted dwellings have
        been found) and there is certainly crop and soil marks suggestive of
        pre-historic occupation. The more northern part is now occupied by an area
        called Blisworth Park containing modest housing that replaced 'mobile
        homes' in the 1970s, which in turn took up an area created as <a href="../Blisgardens.htm"> Pleasure Gardens</a> in
        1845.</font></p>

        and Furrow</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments are made
        under 'North Field' and 'Mill-stream' above. There are a few un-ploughed
        grass fields that still bear strong ridge and furrow patterning. These,
        in the vicinity of the Northton Road, are marked with a lower-case <i>m</i>.</font></p>

        It is on Bryant's 1827 map that the Gayton Road from Blisworth and the
        pond are given the name 'Arbutt' and no-one seems to know why. One
        theory is that there was <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm#arbutt"> an ironstone quarry</a> there, approximate extent
        is marked, from medieval times
        and that it had become worked out to leave a distinct hollow at its
        eastern end, where the level of the land falls away.&nbsp; It is
        presumed that when the
        road was made up a few times in order to make navigation easier through
        the edge of a pond, that said pond then became a permanent feature, deep
        enough to swallow certain <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#arbutt">motorcyclists</a>.</font></p>

        Site</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; The crop and soilmarks are
        dealt with on the <a href="../loundes.htm"> Lowndes page</a> and also in the
        <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Development/archaeo.htm"> archeology review map</a>.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="ironst"></a>Ironstone
        Quarry</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp; As discussed in the <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm">Mining
        Article</a>, there is a distinct possibility that this rough remaining
        hollow, &quot;Fox Covert&quot; on the maps since 1825, in the hillside
        was an ironstone quarry. Many of the oldest houses in the village are
        laid on a substantial wall plate of ironstone. The <a href="../Bridges-history.htm">curate
        reports a known quarry in 1718</a> offering a good red stone. Ironstone
        was not recognised as a source of iron until the mid-1800s.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="ntroad"></a>Northton
        Road</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; As a track, this route is
        doubtless ancient. There is evidence from the lines of double hedging
        that the line once used to climb higher onto the robust ironstone, coming
        from Northampton, rather than become bogged in the grey clay substrate
        at lower levels. The broad grass sides to the east of the road, north of
        the railway bridge, are labelled in 1727 as 'Cottage's Lands' which is
        supposed to mean that it was the location of a baulk at the ends of peasants'
        strips (but why was the baulk so wide?).</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#000080"><a name="poor"></a></font><font color="#0000FF">Poor's
        land</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another baulk
        labelled in the 1727 mapping that was for the poor. It is presumed that rent-free
        peasant strips radiated from both sides of this land. Such feature could
        have been in existence before the <a href="../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm"> 1650 inclosure</a> of this
        area but by 1727 the allocation for the poor was within inclosed fields. The line
        of the baulk is later followed by a field boundary in c1830, on an agent's
        portable pocket map, and there is no reference there to any area that was free
        of rent. In any event the coming of the railway in 1834 - 1838, with the
        need for a wide swath of land for an embankment, spelt an end to the
        area. Could this have been the trigger that caused the Duke of Grafton
        to set up allotments in a field adjacent to the Stoke Road?</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="spring"></a>Spring</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The higher levels had an ironstone substrate and the draining <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Fisher/springs.htm"> of these
        types of strata</a> give rise to springs in many places in the parish. Not
        only has the area suffered from the mining of this ironstone but a
        bypass for the A43 highway required a cutting and this has resulted in
        the removal of the entire Roman
        site and any source for the spring.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="tracks"></a>Access
        tracks</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; The western track was
        named Lowndes Lane. Being dead straight might suggest that it is of 19C in origin
        but in fact it is shown in the 1727 mapping, as shown in the first map <a href="../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm">on
        this page</a>. The other was known as Ford Lane in 19C/20C (altered to
        Station Road after 1850) and
        must have been an important medieval access. It was a track that is shown
        in 1727 withering as it entered the first field after fording the mill-stream.
        The remaining un-inclosed lands (after 1660, mapped in 1727) are in fact only accessible
        from the village using Ford Lane, hence its</font>   <font color="#000080">importance
        and indeed its raison-être (for an explanation please refer to a <a href="details.htm">more
        detailed account</a>). Also, at a much earlier time, before the inclosures of 1649, there
        must have been a main access track from the village which descended
        Chapel Lane (then Mill Lane). This can be surmised from the fact that a <a href="../Chapel/Blis-Baptists.htm">&quot;Little Ease&quot;</a> (a stocks or
        a box) was located at the top of the steepest part - a great place to
        illustrate to peasant farmers what punishments were 'available'.</font></p>

        Wey</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; The section of <a href="../Development/Routes/maptext.htm#oxenford"> route for
        Oxenford Wey</a>, shown traversing from the Roman Villa site across to the
        Gayton Wilds (or to &quot;Snakemore&quot;), is entirely the supposition of this
        author. It seems to fit well but as yet there is no evidence for it! An account of
        many of the local routes is also available from the same link.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="villa"></a>Roman
        Villa Site</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; The site was
        discovered in 1840. The remains of a Roman <a href="../Earthworks.htm"> corn dryer was unearthed</a> when the bypass was
        constructed.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="usage"></a>Warrens</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Interestingly there are warrens marked on 19C field maps for both Gayton
        and Blisworth parishes. There is no further information on the dating of
        this warren area other than to observe that it is likely at some time
        pre-15C when ownerships of both parishes was the King.</font></p>

        The watermill was an overshot type, presumably with headrace boards that
        could be adjusted for a wide range of pond levels. Sufficient water for
        mill was available probably only in winter (Winter brook was a name used
        in 19C) and so a combination of water- and wind-milling was almost
        certainly used at Blisworth.&nbsp; Please see the <a href="../mills-blisworth.htm"> review
        on Milling</a>.</font></p>

        Windmill</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; Of an indeterminate
        age, the windmill is shown on the 1727 mapping and was thought to be
        used by Elizabeth Campion and the Westleys in the early 19C before being
        abandoned in the late 1800s, see some <a href="../Blisworth&#32;Mill/millers-fire.htm">details
        re. the end of its use</a>. In this area, specifically at what was known as
        Dinscote near
        Pattishall, windmills were know <a href="../Development/Routes/maptext.htm#snakemore"> as far back as

        the Manorial Fish-pool below. The exact line of the brook as it descends
        from the fish-pool is not known but it seems reasonable to expect it
        followed the line of the canal.&nbsp; The extension
        towards Milton Malsor is named Washbrook. There is a <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/Fisher/springs.htm"> discussion
        of the water table</a> with regard to the recent spell when it dried out. Mention

        into diverse green lanes) on what was called South Street (now
        Stoke Road after 1800 when it was extended south by 2 miles). The main street was defined by a few cottages on the
        Northton Road (Northampton Road) through to the bridge over the brook
        (probably Bridge Street but now is the Hish Street). There were a few
        cottages to the north of Bridge Street, along Mill Lane (is now Chapel
        Lane).</font></p>

        where it crossed a deep gouge due to water run-off and quarrying (so it is believed).&nbsp;
        The name of the path out of the village was Dingley Lane, named probably
        after a 17th century tenant farmer.&nbsp; The bridge
        over the brook in Blisworth was
        very likely, at one time, augmented by a ford across the brook. This is evident from
        the alignment of the paths, the pronounced low level in the present
        Gayton Road (near the parking gate) and the curious sharp kink in Bridge
        Street (before it was straightened out c1960).
        In <a href="../Misc-justtwo.htm#ford">the flash flood of 1992</a> the
        two paths, both old and recent, as drawn in the map, turned to streams

        spring in 1718</a> which is where we first hear of its name.&nbsp; It is clear
        that it drained the medieval quarry to its immediate south-west and
        probably emanated from the limestone strata before the quarry was first
        opened up. At present, the spring becomes visible as it enters what is
        currently called 'The Park'. In the field, further up, there are presumably drains to keep the
        surface dry. However a darker soil colour marks out the track of a once
        verdant stream emanating somewhere near the edge of the quarry. There
        were bits of 19th century pottery in that stream, being an indication of
        villagers' picnics. There was a fresh water reservoir tank near the
        quarry c1890 <a href="../West&#32;Bridge/Grafton&#32;House/Grafton&#32;House.htm#watertank">which
        served Grafton House</a> (Westley bros. in occupation) well before mains water came to the village in 1953.&nbsp;</font></p>

        Green</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is assumed that this triangular
        common land patch was called &quot;The Green&quot; in medieval times.
        The name of the location of the two cottages bordering the allotment
        gardens (formerly the warren) <a href="../Stokerd02.htm#green"> has been &quot;the Green&quot;</a> in
        Victorian times. We assume the name was adopted many hundreds of years
        before then. Other names that have appeared are &quot;Goose Green&quot;
        and &quot;South-Gutter Green&quot;. The green <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#green"> was lost in
        1796</a>; excavated entirely in order to gain a tunnel
        access at 90 metres above sea-level for the canal on its way to Stoke
        Bruerne. A kink in the outline of the land at the western corner is
        interpreted as the point through which the brook, as the fish-pool
        overflow, passes into the field
        and thence into the Manor grounds.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="fishpool"></a>Manorial
        Fish-pool</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; A pool known <a href="../Fisher/Fishweir.htm"> as
        Young's Pool c1705</a> as distinct from the millpond is documented. The
        field name is Fishweir Close (1727). The lie of the land clearly was quite low
        and some of it has flooded occasionally. Some other parts have been
        filled with old bricks from canal tunnel repairs (see previous hot-link)
        and there was once a
        traverse by a <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/HillRailway.htm"> horse railway</a> that was built on an embankment of
        earth.&nbsp;The pool was drained by 1727(obviously) and there is
        interestingly two little paddock fields along the north boundary of 'Fishweir
        field' assigned to separate tenants. These paddocks have an uneven
        outline and for that reason they are both assumed to be once beneath the
        fish-pool.&nbsp; Believe it or not, to a substantial extent, the drained
        fields that were once a fish-pool have been excavated away for the
        canal, along with most of the area of the Green.<br>
        The detailed outline of the path running on the western edge of the pool
        is interesting; at the southern end the paths fan out considerably and I
        interpret this as 'track braiding', in this case because there was a
        ford there. At the northern end the path is notched as though providing
        room to negotiate a bridge, one which would carry a horse and heavy cart
        because such would be needed to access stone from the quarry to the
        west. It is conceivable that a fish-trap (ie. fish-weir) was built
        integrated with the bridge.<br>
        The map shows detail of the number of streams thought to once drain into
        the fish-pool, in some cases only during the winter months.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="ancquarry"></a>Medieval
        Quarry</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two quarries,
        the larger of which was first observed by both the current farmer and by a
        villager who took a <a href="../aerialviews.htm#quarry"> air-balloon flight</a> over the village.&nbsp; The
        smaller quarry was discovered in some RAF 1945 aerial survey
        photographs. The 1727 map names the field for the larger quarry as
        &quot;<a href="../Farming/fieldnames.htm">Slatpitt Furlong</a>&quot; and this implies the stone was best used
        for slating and not for building freestone.&nbsp; The featuring,
        particularly evident in the larger quarry, is revealed by crop and stone
        markings. It suggests the manual manner in which the stone was gained as
        well as showing that the quarrymen knew how to keep the inroads well
        drained. Some <a href="../RQuarry/roman-farm.htm"> Roman remains</a> just to the north of the larger quarry
        indicate a possible farmstead in the area.&nbsp; The present day undulations
        in level, which run with the crop-marking, is typically of up to 3 foot
        amplitude (see previous hot-link) - one wonders how deep were the original gullies. Similar
        patterns are visible just to the north of Stoke Goldington.</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="saltway"></a>Saltway</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        First <a href="../Articles/Roman-Salt-Way.html"> brought to our attention</a> by a writer to the website (2006) from
        knowledge of a 'ramblers society project', the Saltway extends from the
        Droitwich area in the west and continues east by a <a href="../Articles/saltway-east.htm">possible
        three routes</a> that all initially use
        the Knock Lane alignment. Two routes appear to join the earlier
        discovered network of Roman routes whilst a third may well run through the Salcey forest
        and continue to the east. Village historians in Stoke Goldington
        and in Olney have been contacted with no success regarding its
        continuation.&nbsp; The 'Saltway' is documented by the <a href="../Bridges-history.htm"> curate in
        Blisworth in 1718</a> although he was not explicit.&nbsp; When the 100 acres surrounding Glebe Farm was
        assigned to the Church, c1780 - 1808, we can surmise that the footpath
        just to the south, following a tributary of the Brook, was preferred and
        pressed into
        service.<br>
        It is tempting to assume that the Saltway was as an important trackway
        for Blisworth (as important as the 'main' road through Towcester), a trading route not
        just for salt but probably also for timber, stone and stock.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20; padding-right: 300"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="nunnlane"></a>Nunn
        Lane</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp; All villagers know of Nunn
        Lane. It extends south to Nunn Wood which is a good bluebell venue. In
        c1155 there was established a <a href="../Walks&#32;and&#32;Legging/Tour.htm#priory"> Priory at Showsley (was
        Sewardsley)</a>  just south of Nunn Wood (off this map) and
        according to the research report (forward linked from there) the nuns from there were know to the Lord of
        the Manor (Thomas Wake) as early as in 1470. The green trackway also is
        likely to have been a significant route that headed due south from
        Northampton extending to Watling Street in the region of Paulespury with
        the fortified 'station' at Alderton presiding over the river crossing.
        The passage of a north-south route from Blisworth parish to Shutlanger
        parish is <a href="../Bridges-history.htm">recorded as a 'cross'</a> in
        1718.</font></p>

        Parish of Easton-Neston field map indicates <a href="../Farming/fieldnames.htm"> this field

        uneven outline suggests it was a wood and the name implies a wood
        associated with a substantial household (Ekwall even mentions a
        nunnery!).&nbsp; It is not unreasonable to
        ring Henwood and Nunn Wood, also Burn Wood nearby as woodland associated
        with the priory.&nbsp; The sharply polygonal fields nearby were shaped at
        the time of <a href="../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm"> the inclosures</a>
        probably as late as 1808.</font></p>
