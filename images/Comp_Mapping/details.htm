        <p><font color="#000080">* The origin of Ford Lane, ie. in relation to
        Cromwell, was explained to my partner recently and after careful thought
        I was asked why I had never studied a more practical skill such as
        ironing.<br>

        <font color="#000080">Present day centre-lines are shown in dashed
        narrow lines for the railway, Station Road and the Canal, as a visual
        guide.</font>
        <p>
        <font color="#000080">Date of map is 1727 by which time the <a href="../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm"> inclosures
        due to Cromwell</a> in 1649 had been consolidated into various farmers' and
        villagers' plots. A substantial 'feudal' open field, North Field
        remained. Tracks and roads are shown in light brown. From the
        Northampton road is branched 'Ford Lane' which <b> appears to have existed
        simply for access over a ford to the North Field*</b>. The lane may have
        taken the line of an earlier baulk. Field boundaries labelled with '</font><i><font color="#0000FF">f'</font></i><font color="#000080">
        are thought to have been fenced in 1649 and probably remained so by
        1727. It seems likely that the area between the 1649 inclosures and the
        stream, in the north, was left in the open field at first but was, by
        1727, assigned to a prominent farmer (W. Plowman).&nbsp; Earlier than
        1649 (or maybe a considerably earlier date), the area to the south of the North Field was also open field and
        the alignment of the strips and lands are revealed by the field
        boundaries - see pink guide lines.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Interesting is the fact that by 1727 the
        earlier inclosed area had been subdivided into many units ranging in
        size from 1 to 4 acres (see the inclosures article) with a popular size
        being 2 acres. The reasons for this are to be discussed elsewhere but it
        appears to reflect <a href="../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm#ptfarming">a
        need for part-time farming</a>.
        Fields names beside the mill-stream indicate much larger fields
        originally; Mill Close to the west and Northampton Way Close to the
        east. Large fields became the rule again in the 19C with the final
        inclosure Parliamentary Act.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The water-mill building is shown as a single
        ridge with one chimney and with a door to the north. It is fair to
        assume that early 18C mappers aimed to depict buildings faithfully. The mill-stream
        emanating from the wheel is shown aligned with the centre of the
        building and passing under a small bridge. Hence it is assumed the wheel
        was inside the building. Although the pond was once
        extensive we know it was considerably reduced by 1727 as is approximately
        shown in the map.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">As <a href="compmap.htm">recounted elsewhere</a>, the action of cutting
        and straightening the mill-stream so that it could be fence efficiently
        would be likely to have resulted in 'loss of direction' for the water
        once emerging into the open field, hence the drift and the creation of
        two branches to the stream, for safety's sake, by railway engineers in
        1835.</font></p>
