      search was conducted to find one of the original (postwar?) <b>NCC</b> village name signs,
        constructed in cast iron as are some surviving street signs in town, but
        in Blisworth they have all been replaced with sheet aluminium versions and these
        current designs are photographed below before they, in turn, are whisked into oblivion by
        a &quot;new order&quot;. Note that the typesetter for the newer one, on the left, has applied a differing perspective on
        what provides clarity and opted for
      cost-saving monochrome.</span></font><center>

      was some excitement in 2012 when the </font></span><font color="#000080"> <b>PPPT</b></font><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
      (that is the <b>P</b>arish <b>P</b>lan <b>P</b>rogress <b>T</b>eam) entered the village into a countywide <a href="../Occasions/best&#32;vill.htm">competition
      for &quot;best village&quot;</a> and won three trophies in that year. Some
      fabric banners, some 7 foot by one in size, were strung up at one or two entrances to the village but were taken down a few weeks later in response
      to a ruling that they breached local planning rules. Alas, there was no
      photographic record made. The </font></span><font color="#000080"> <b>PPPT</b></font><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
      then worked on a design that would be compliant and the claim of <b>best
      in 2012</b> would be incorporated into a heritage design already in use in
      Towcester, being one based on gold lettering on a black background. It
      will eventually be placed at every approach to the village and will become
      the</font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">
      </span><b>new order,</b>
      alluded to in the above. Highways took quite a time in coming to an
      agreement about the new signs and there was some concern that the design would
      then end up with a '30' sign incorporated into it. Many
      months had elapsed since the start of this action and some delay was
      involved in the Parish Council having to sign an undertaking to pay for
      any maintenance that the signs may need. Then there was a considerable
      delay - so much so that this web-page goes out before it's done - 'Sign of
      the Times' overflows into 2014. Anyway, we soon learnt that the &quot;best
      in 2012&quot; would be incorporated into the village sign mentioned below
      (see &quot;Totem&quot;) and that the upgrading of all the village traffic
      signs was shelved. SNC's contribution is shown here.</font></p>

      Grave Matter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A
        project in recent months has been <a href="../Graves/graves.htm">the
        tidying of the village graveyards</a>. The </font></span><font color="#000080"> <b>PPPT</b></font><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
      has been helping with
        this also and to commemorate the improvements to the supplementary graveyard
        on the High Street a sign was put up near the gate to make everyone
        aware of the winning of a 'Silver' Award from the Northamptonshire Wild
      Life Trust. Quite what to
        call this graveyard presented an opportunity for long discussions on how
        its name should be recorded. The graveyard was created as a <b>Cemetery</b>
        in 1863 being the word for any unattached or annexed burial place and that
        is how it is labelled in the Ordnance Survey mapping right up to the present, this
        being followed by the <b>SNC</b> in their official map (based on
      Ordnance Survey) of
        the village. This has been explained to the </font></span><font color="#000080"> <b>PPPT</b></font><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
      but they are aware that a minority of villagers refer to the graveyard as &quot;the Old Graveyard&quot;
      because &quot;Cemetery&quot; sounds impersonal and irreligious. <i>This
      alternative naming is wrong, of course, and one can argue that signs
        should never be wrong.</i> What transpired, in part paid for and
      supported by the
      Parish Council, is just fine and presents a rewarding amount of background
      information. This information board was officially unveiled on Saturday,
      3rd May 2014.</font></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080"><b>Village
        'Totem'</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; For
        a number of years there had been discussions regarding an emblazoned
        &quot;Blisworth&quot; village sign that would be set up at a central point. There were
        always two main questions: (i) which central point - should it be at the
        Royal Oak or at the place of the now removed Elm Tree and (ii) what
        should the design be? The </font></span><font color="#000080"> <b>PPPT</b></font><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">
        in conjunction with the
        Parish Council took up the task of organising a bit of a vote and it was
        subsequently decided the sign should go at Elm Tree corner and be based on
        a large board that could be viewed from either side. A sign at that
        location should ideally face three ways and be prominently sited but
        issues such as the
        potential clutter and the existence of complex underground services
        seemed to direct everyone to mounting the panel near the existing
        Blisworth Heritage plinth, or even directly over it - the only problem with that
        being that the sign would not be easily noticeable to travellers
        coming through from either Towcester or Northampton. The chosen designer Ivan Chester and artist
        Alan Baillie (to be seen below) have opted to
        picture a canal narrow-boat under the name &quot;Blisworth&quot; and
        depict two seasons on the two sides. It has turned out to be a
        fine piece of work but the Parish Council has become concerned about
        planning permission and shelling out £200 for the fee to the <b>SNC</b>
        - yet they worry about asking neighbours for their approval (which is
        what the <b>SNC</b> want the fee for!). With the announcement that the frame
        for the board will take time to design, to construct and install we knew that
        the job will take months to complete. However, the unveiling occurred on 22nd
        July 2014 but even this was improvised at the last moment when the
        contractors promised for the frame on which to mount the sign had become
        insolvent and a large artist's easel was used instead. The sign was
        properly installed soon after.<br>

        <b>Improvements at the Tunnel Hut</b>&nbsp; Over a number of months the
        Canal Partnership has been active in improving the area near&nbsp; to
        the tunnel mouth. The hut there is <a href="../CanalScape/stable.htm"> now available as a venue</a> for
        youngsters' nature projects - indeed anything one might come up with. In
        mid-November the hut was adorned with an attractive sign painted by
        Colin Dundas and John Percival which explains who the groups are that supported it.</font></span>
