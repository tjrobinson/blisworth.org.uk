        &quot;Adamant&quot;</font></b>&nbsp; In 2005 there were bicentenary celebrations at both Blisworth
        and Stoke Bruerne of the original opening of Blisworth Tunnel in 1805. <b>Adamant</b>,
        a restored steam tug, along with President were present
        at the event, plying back and forth through the tunnel.&nbsp; I shot <b> Adamant</b> as it emerged at the North Portal on one occasion and posted
        the picture in the &quot;<a href="../Bicentenary02.htm#adamant">bicentenary
        pages</a>&quot;.  I also used the shot to
        adorn our homepage since Blisworth Tunnel is, of course, an icon of the village.&nbsp;
        Then, in 2006, the village
        tapestry project was started and the picture was adopted into
        the collage for the <a href="../tapestry.htm"> central largest tapestry</a> of
        the seven being created.  Being now an
        icon, also, for the tapestry which is very nearly finished, it
        was thought a good idea to invite <b> Adamant</b> back to
        join in these celebrations.</font></P>
        <P>  <font color="#000080">
        Marketed at this anniversary celebration were bookmarkers with <b>
        Adamant</b>  shown again emerging from the North Portal (the image is
        posted here <a href="../Misc&#32;Places/panoramas.htm#q">in the panoramas
        section</a>).&nbsp; This was achieved by
        using digital
        superimposition techniques with the hope that no one will worry that
        the picture originates from 2005.  There were also some limited issue
        ink drawings by Phil Cahill of <b> Adamant</b> based on the original picture
        and even some souvenir postcards bearing a reduced scale replica of Phil's
        work.  It is, of course, Phil's drawing that celebrates the re-opening and not
        those particular movements of <b>Adamant's</b>.&nbsp; However the owner,
        Mr. <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Phil Martino,</span>
        was given a job at
        <u> these</u>
        celebrations: to cut the tape, thus re-enacting on August 22, 2009 the
        opening of the tunnel after extensive repair work in the 1980s.</font></P>

        The crisis in the tunnel reach criticality in 1980 when BW closed the
        tunnel amidst cries of consternation.&nbsp; By 1982 a project had
        started to patch repair with renewed brickwork at certain places
        throughout and completely replace the walls with a new circular
        &quot;skin&quot; within the central third of the length.&nbsp; An
        account in both <a href="../tunnel-1982.htm"> pictures and memoirs</a> is to be found on this
        website.&nbsp; In places where a significant amount of patch work was
        done date bricks were placed to indicate that the repairs were part of
        the 1982 - 84 project.&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The

        <p><font color="#000080" size="4"><b>THE DAY'S HAPPENINGS:</b></font><font color="#000080"><b><br>
        At the North Portal and in the Tunnel&nbsp; </b>The scene began with
        restored steam-tug <b>Adamant</b> pushing through a commemorative tape,
        recalling the end of repairs in 1984, and letting off much whistling (by
        steam of course) and smoke.&nbsp; While we applauded the event, the band
        &quot;Chase&quot; (with links to Blisworth - see note below), picked up
        with the mood with some of their repertoire of appealing songs.&nbsp;
        Youngsters, organised by the Scouts, played with homemade rafts in the canal and Frank Bedford
        re-enacted the same role as he did in 1984, as postmaster offering
        first-day coverings (since he was in charge of the Blisworth Post Office
        from 1979 to 1986).&nbsp; He hired the same 1780 postmaster costume as last time
        but found that he couldn't cope with the trousers any more so he
        improvised with casual trousers of his own.&nbsp; He generated quite a
        bit of interest and even managed to sell a few left-over 1984 first-day
        covers.&nbsp; We have a <a href="FBedford-1984.jpg">black-and-white
        picture of him in 1984</a>, sat in a classic narrow-boat at Stoke
        Bruerne.<br>
        After hearing the news
        that the day-boat had broken down, we were not expecting Jan Andrews to
        come by with a boatful of VIPs.&nbsp; However, something creative was done with
        the day-boat's transmission so she was back 'on-track' brandishing the
        beautiful pennant that was to be swapped with a similar one from Stoke
        Bruerne at the
        halfway point in the tunnel.&nbsp; Jan Andrews was to represent the
        newly-reborn (<i>yet still informally structured</i>) Blisworth Canal Partnership in an exchange with Helen
        Westlake from the Stoke Bruerne Canal Partnership; the exchange was an
        expression of our villages' sharing the historic tunnel <a href="../BBook/BBook.html#canal"> which was
        created back in 1805</a>.&nbsp; We may be unique - someone pointed out he
        could not think of another tunnel, anywhere in the UK, having a village
        at both ends.<br>
        <b>Notes:</b>&nbsp; The band <b>&quot;Chase&quot;</b> is Crystal Hawes (Vocal) and Aaron
        Burbidge (Guitar).&nbsp;Crystal grew up in Blisworth, in Buttmead to be
        exact!&nbsp; Aaron is from Northampton but is a grandson of <a href="../People-two.htm#bernard">Bernard
        Burbidge</a>, the Blisworth garage owner, and of Connie
        Burbidge.<br>
        The<b> Pennants</b> were designed by <a href="pennants.jpg"> Brian
        Collings</a>, artist at Stoke
        Bruerne, and embroidered by Alison Clipstone who grew up in Blisworth,
        living part of the time in a flat at the Sun, Moon and Stars building
        (and will such an address ever be on Royal Mail's registered list again,
        we wonder . . .)<br>

        <p><font color="#000080"><b>At the Wharf of &quot;Blisworth Tunnel
        Narrowboats&quot;&nbsp; </b>We could hear the Church bells pealing for
        most of the morning.&nbsp; On offer were BBQ'ed pork and a &quot;real
        ale&quot; bar laid on by the Royal Oak Inn.&nbsp; There was a jumble
        sale by the Scouts &amp; Guides and an array of souvenirs for the day
        comprising a limited edition print of a ink drawing of
        &quot;Adamant&quot; emerging from the tunnel (by Blisworth's Phil
        Cahill), postcards with the same
        image and some bookmarkers showing a <a href="../Misc&#32;Places/panoramas.htm#q"> panoramic photograph of the North
        Portal</a>.&nbsp; These souvenirs were also on sale in the Church and at the
        Chapel Rooms - see below.&nbsp; There were exhibitions showing
        engineering schematics for the 1984 tunnel repairs with some of George
        Freeston's photographs taken during the project.&nbsp; There was also an
        array of Blisworth snaps taken of crowds and events taken during the
        celebrations of 22 August 1984.&nbsp; A DVD was running to display TV
        'footage' of the coverage of the 1984 event and a short video sequence
        made by Grosvenor (the makers of the tunnelling shield used in the
        repairs).&nbsp; These video sequences were taken from <a href="../Tunnel1982/Eng-account.htm">Robin
        Garrett</a>'s collection of VHS tapes.&nbsp; Robin Garrett was the
        British Waterways agent for the project, involved deeply at the planning
        stage and on a part-time basis during the actual work.&nbsp; He could
        not be present at the anniversary because a daughter was getting married
        that day.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some speeches made by James Clifton
        (Regenerative Manager at British Waterways) and Jan Andrews from the
        Blisworth Canal Partnership, being one of the chief organisers for the day's
        events at Blisworth.&nbsp; There was a jolly gathering at the Wharf for
        most of the day, while &quot;<b>Chase</b>&quot; continued to charm us.<br>
        <b>The Wharf</b> was also a terminus for trips to the tunnel mouth run
        by the St John's Ambulance boat and a day-boat &quot;Crusader
        Mountbatten&quot;.&nbsp; The commercial boat &quot;Indian Chief&quot;, based at
        Stoke Bruerne, also called at the wharf three times during the day to
        deposit passengers who had options of returning to Stoke Bruerne by
        vintage bus or by the same boat.&nbsp; On the St John boat, cream teas
        were served by a three-some of Blisworth ladies - see bonnets below.&nbsp;
        All the comings and goings, food readiness and explanations of what was available
        to see was
        expertly compèred by John Percival.<br>
        <b>Notes:</b>&nbsp; The <b>Two technical exhibition boards</b> were assembled by Tony Marsh.<br>
        <b>One of James Clifton's</b> early posts within British Waterways was
        to work with Robin Garrett - to inject a little bit of architectural
        expertise into what hitherto was a purely engineer's domain - small
        world!<br>
        The boat <b>Indian Chief</b> was given a hand-me-down name after various
        boats - no connection with the Lantsbery leisure <a href="../Canal/Arm/sandlanding.htm">project
        at the Arm</a> based upon Indian canoes, a shame that.<br>
        The <b>Bonneted</b> cream tea three-some were Denise Ingram, Val Penn
        and Frances Snowden from Blisworth WI.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080"><b>At the Chapel Coffee Shop and Rooms&nbsp; </b>Well,
        the chief interest here, for many, was the food (Ploughman's lunches and
        cakes) and tea or coffee.&nbsp; The rooms are normally run by the
        Baptist Church on Tuesdays but on this occasion the ladies in the
        Blisworth Tapestry team, with their finishing line laid before them in
        February 2010, provided the service.&nbsp; They had got in enough for
        &quot;an army&quot; yet sold out - they were briefly overwhelmed by
        demand at one point.&nbsp; Carol Arnall, tapestry
        project leader, presented framed copies of the limited edition print to
        the crew of <b>Adamant</b>, in appreciation of their appearance.&nbsp; That's
        Crewman Chris and Owner Phil Martino, on the right, holding their pictures.<br>
        As had
        already happened in Stoke Bruerne in the morning, a couple of engineers
        involved deeply with the 1984 tunnel repairs, Roy Slocombe (seated) and
        John Woods, gave a talk and slide-show on the trials and tribulations encountered at
        Blisworth - actually that project ran extremely smoothly.&nbsp; Their
        roles in the project were as follows: Roy Slocombe was Projects Manager
        at Mowlems and was responsible for the planning of the entire project
        including the initial survey work.&nbsp; John Woods was the Mowlem Agent
        on site.&nbsp; Day to day running of the project was his job,
        interfacing with managers of the miners gang and the surface gang.&nbsp;
        Some of their slides were new to us.&nbsp; Now lodged on the website are
        some new pictures of the <a href="../Fisher/Fishweir.htm">hill railway
        embankment and the infill</a> to the east of it, the <a href="../tunneltwo-1982.htm">hand-built
        initial accommodation</a> for the tunnel shield and <a href="../tunnel-1982.htm">a
        drainage header</a> being cleared out.<br>

        <p><font color="#000080"><b>At the Church&nbsp;</b> A sub-group of the
        Blisworth WI organised a book reader's club some years ago calling
        themselves &quot;Bookworms&quot;.&nbsp; They meet frequently to exchange
        and discuss books.&nbsp; In the Church they displayed an appreciation of
        various books and had available the
        all-important cups of tea from 2pm onwards.&nbsp; There was also a display of
        art&nbsp; put on by the Blisworth Art Group with work by Maureen Smith
        MA, Maggie Turton and Brenda Warner.&nbsp; They helpfully agreed to
        place the &quot;tunnel souvenirs&quot; on sale - postcards and
        bookmarkers along with some postcards of Maggie Turton's showing
        depictions of Candle Bridge in both <a href="../Chapellane.htm#art"> Cubist and Pointillist
        </a> styles.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080"><b>Epilogue - Comment for the historical
        record:</b>  Noted during the organisation of
        this event was a distinct divide in the interests at the two
        villages:&nbsp;the Blisworth fraternity just wanted to have a
        pleasant Saturday and lay on gentle entertainment along with some
        worthwhile souvenirs.&nbsp; That relaxed approach doesn't always match
        that at Stoke - it's almost as though there is a gentle animosity
        between the villages that stems from history and culture.&nbsp; But the
        'day', at the Blisworth end at any rate, was an enormous success - so
        much so that many Blisworthians and a few within British Waterways
        believe that we should aim to have some sort of 'Canal Festivity' every
        year - and good luck to that!&nbsp;
