        detailed account of the 'business' of staff in a signal box</a> with
        some emphasis on the main signal box at Blisworth station.
        <p>&quot;At Blisworth station signal box I got to know a signalman,
        <a href="Rails-three.htm#morrisroe"> Jack Morrisroe</a>, a super bloke, who lived in the old railway cottages on the
        old A43 near where it's crossed by the railway.&nbsp; Jack was a
        Staffordshire lad.&nbsp; His father was ganger, in charge of a team of
        platelayers responsible for track maintenance, at Standon Bridge between
        Stafford and Crewe and I believe Jack started his railway life as a
        booking boy (whose job was to accurately record the times trains passed
        the signal box) in the Basford Hall Sorting Sidings South box which
        controlled the huge goods marshalling yard south of Crewe.</p>
        <p>&quot;The Blisworth box had 75  levers and was one of the largest on the LMS to be staffed by only one  man plus a booking boy.&nbsp;
        The levers most used were at the extreme ends, being nos. 1,2,3,4,5 and
        73,74,75, and on summer weekends it was exceptionally  busy as most people went on holiday by train in those days.&nbsp;
        There were  also extensive goods sidings on the up side (very busy at
        night time!) plus  branches to Northampton and Towcester.&nbsp; There
        were loops for goods trains on each side of the up and down main lines
        between Blisworth and Gayton and there was an up line intermediate block signal on the ascent  towards
        Roade.</p>

        lined and they originally were either blue with silver stripes or
        red with gold stripes.&nbsp; The stripes are not apparent in this

         parlous state of our railways after the WWII - &quot;most engines were painted in matt black in
         WWII including the Duchesses as shown in the photo. It does seem strange as I would think a
         black engine was as easy to see as a maroon one. I have read somewhere that
