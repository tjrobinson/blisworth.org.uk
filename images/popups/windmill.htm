<p>Once or twice in the censuses, this lane to the east
was called <b>Windmill Lane</b>.&nbsp; About a quarter of a mile to the east was
a pole-windmill which used fabric sails.&nbsp; It was used right up to about
1850 and then allowed to fall into disuse because the milling family (Westleys)
were using steam by then.&nbsp;

It was again used briefly c. 1880</a> because the
steam mill caught fire.</p>
