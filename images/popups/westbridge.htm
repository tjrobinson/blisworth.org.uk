West Bridge</a></b>&nbsp; The bridge is not clearly
shown on
the map.&nbsp; Perhaps this is because it would need to be only a small bridge.&nbsp;
In about
1793 it would have been rebuilt as a humpback bridge over the new Grand Junction
Canal.&nbsp; The High Street at this end of the village was called Bridge
Street.</p>
