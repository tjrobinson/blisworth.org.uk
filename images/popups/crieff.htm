In 1798 this house was also
badly damaged by fire</a>.&nbsp; It seems it lost its roof and eastern gable and
nearly lost its western gable.&nbsp; The wing to the house which extends along
Stoke Road may have been a separate dwelling at one time - it too was damaged
and not rebuilt.&nbsp; Crieff House had the status of a farm but with only a
paddock associated with it in the Grafton rent books.&nbsp; Perhaps it was a merchant's house.&nbsp;
By the late 19th century it was occupied by the Westley family.</p>
