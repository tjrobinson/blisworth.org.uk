</b> located at the bottom of Mill Lane.&nbsp; The mill used an overshot
wheel and its existence accounts for the name of the field now replacing the pond -
&quot;Pond Bank&quot;.&nbsp; In fact by 1729 the pond had been drained into a
tiny one which surely could have not driven the wheel for more than half a
day.&nbsp; This situation is clearly shown in the original 1729 map, <a href="G4212-1729-watermill.jpg">part
of which can be seen here</a>.<br>
