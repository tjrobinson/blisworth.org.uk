Westleys oldest buildings</a>&nbsp; </b>The Westley
family bought this small patch at some time in the 18th century.&nbsp; In 1838 it is assigned to Ann Westley, miller.&nbsp; Both she and
her son developed this part into what is known as the Westley Buildings.&nbsp;
They were demolished in 1939.</p>
