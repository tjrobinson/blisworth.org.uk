</a> (Chapel) and its associated buildings and
graveyard.&nbsp; This might be the barn used in the late 18th century for
non-conformists prayers.&nbsp; Eventually the more prosperous members of the
movement bought the land and built a chapel in 1825.&nbsp; The road which runs
past the plot was called Mill Lane but this was changed to Chapel Lane.&nbsp; An
intriguing detail is that when this plot was put in trust for the Baptist
movement, it was referred to as &quot;The Little Ease&quot; which implies that a
medieval punishment cell or the stocks were once located there.&nbsp; [<b>Little Ease</b>, <i>slang
for a cell or pillory too small to either stand or lie down in</i>]</font></p>
