        There will be hundreds of pictures on this site - there is an economic limit to the
        webspace available.&nbsp; The point of this presentation is that <b>you
        can see for yourself the <u>extent</u> of the collection </b>and return
        later as the collection expands - as it surely will.&nbsp; Any interest in copies of a picture
        at a higher resolution (ie. clarity) should be directed
        through contacts given in the Blisworth &quot;Round and About&quot;
        parish council publication or using the comment form on the home page.&nbsp; In some cases the pictures are not available due to copyright restrictions.&nbsp;
        However, permission has been obtained, where
        possible, to include them here.&nbsp; Printed below each image is the
        photographer's name, if known.

        <p>That the field to the right, once the <a href="Blisgardens.htm">Gardens</a>,
        had become a private caravan site (emergency housing approved by the
        county council) by 1960 is suggested by one or two caravans in view but
        in fact there were by then 70 dwellings.&nbsp; When <a href="Bypass&#32;History.htm">the bypass</a> was
        built, the extension of Station Road to the right, ie. to the north,
        from the hotel front was subsumed into the site which had become by 1975
        a park of mobile homes and prefab style dwellings.</p>
