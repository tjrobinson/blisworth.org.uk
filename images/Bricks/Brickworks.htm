        </o:p><font size="5">Blisworth Bricks!</font>&nbsp; The late George Freeston
        had
        been looking for a sample for many years.&nbsp; People working on old
        buildings in Blisworth were asked by George if they ever have seen a
        Blisworth Brick.&nbsp; Whilst George looked* in vain, so did I.&nbsp; One
        would have expected me to find evidence of Blisworth Bricks because I lived at
        Candle Cottage for 20 years and dug up numerous broken bricks.&nbsp; I
        demolished a poorly constructed kitchen to Candle Cottage which was
        built of bricks of precisely this shape - 9&quot; x 4¼&quot; x 3&quot;
        and found none with this marking in the shallow frog.&nbsp; On c1900
        ordnance survey maps the field there was given the name Brick-Kiln Field.&nbsp;
        It lies low enough in Blisworth to rest on a deep belt of blue lias
        clay, perfect material for pottery and bricks.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">This
      sample was found in around 2005 by Bob Williams who has lived in the
      village for 10s of years.&nbsp; He was working on the lower boundary wall
      of the old graveyard by the Baptist Chapel.&nbsp; That wall was built <a href="../Chapel/1865-Enlargements.htm">around
      1865
      to 1871</a> and this brick appears to never have been laid but left in the
      footings as surplus - a red X marks the spot in the map below.&nbsp; The site at the wall
      (not shown built in 1838) is only 200 yards as the
      crow flies from where there were brick kilns at the Candle Cottage location.&nbsp;
      The date is spot on too for the brickmaking activity of the <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~blinkofamily/images/sbjbp.htm"> Peasnall
      family</a>.&nbsp; This family actually lived in the High Street but it is
      certain they worked the field by the Canal because according to the 1838
      Grafton Survey the field later called Brick-Kiln Field was let to William
      Peasnall.</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Other references
        to Blisworth brick making are the following: the <a href="../Blisworth&#32;Tunnel/ludlams.htm">Ludlam
        family</a> is reported to have kilns in Stoke Bruerne and Blisworth.&nbsp;
        Maybe the Ludlams, before their bankruptcy, rented this field in around
        1800 and perhaps provided bricks for the canal bridges and the
        tunnel.&nbsp; There is another reference that is documented in more
        detail and that is of <a href="../Canal/Arm/Arm-general.htm">Mr. Savage</a>
        who operated at Blisworth Arm.&nbsp; He probably began in c1855 and the
        family continued through to about 1911.&nbsp; Their brickworks, on the
        present site of Gayton Marina (in Blisworth parish), was taken over by
        the Asplin family who were supplying bricks to Northampton
        builders, transporting them down the Northampton Arm.&nbsp; The Savages
        lived at Arm Farm but
        the Asplins were from Milton Malsor.&nbsp; The extraction of the clay
        was moved, by the Asplins at some point, from the marina site to one
        that was just in Milton parish known locally as &quot;the Kottler-Heron&quot;
        site.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">The Brick-Kiln
      Field was feudal-style common land in 1600, used for clay excavation 1800
      - c1880, planted as an apple and damson orchard c1925 after the Grafton
      Sale of 1919, became accommodation
      for sheep, goats and a few horses 1978 - 2001 and then acquired a small
      lake, an earthmoving plant garage plus some facilities, later carefully
      removed, for cultivating for research purposes THC bearing botanical
      species since then, for a short period.&nbsp;
      Some orchard trees remain as do some horses.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">* - actually, by
      1986, George <i>had</i> found a sample but in his <b>NRO</b> records he
      doesn't say where from.&nbsp; He does not mention the Peasnall connection,
      nor does he actually identify a brickworks.&nbsp; Instead he points to the
      Savage/Asplin company, as above, with the full name &quot;<i>Blisworth
      Brick and Tile Company</i>&quot;.&nbsp; He also mentions the &quot;<i>Northamptonshire
      Brick Company</i>&quot; that was located very near Blisworth Arm but in
      Gayton parish; the site of the old County &quot;Tip&quot;.&nbsp; This site
      was characterised by a 200 foot chimney until 1914 when it was
      demolished.&nbsp; I favour the Peasnall source because '<i>tiles</i>' are
      not part of the name in the frog.&nbsp; Incidentally some companies pack
      quite a long title into the frog; &quot;<i>Easton Estate &amp; Mining
      Company Ltd, Towcester</i>&quot;. In other words, George appears to have
      never known that the field by the canal was called &quot;Brick-kiln
      Field&quot; and never realised the Peasnall connection that is heavily
      hinted at in the census and in the 1838 mapping.</font></p>
