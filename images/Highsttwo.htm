        many Grafton estate records were lost in a fire there is little detail

        </span>Up until about 1955 it was enclosed on the High Street side by
        three small cottages, a sweet shop and a blacksmith’s workshop, all of
        which were demolished to yield a small car park and lawns to go with the
        small field surrounding and attached to the building.<o:p>

        thatch was retained until 1959 when it was destroyed by a fire that is
        thought to have been a vandal attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In 1727 it was associated with a maltings that could have

        in 1831, it is renamed the Royal Oak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>That name has been for many years been the traditional
        ‘mascot’ name for the British Army as well as recalling the legend

        Cromwell’s army in c1646.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
        is no record why the Blisworth pub should be given that name other than

        thatch over the Royal Oak caught fire.&nbsp; That was in the days when
        the M1 was being built; there was much bulk movement of earth by heavy
        lorries through the village and the <a href="Blisgardens.htm#M1">'Caravan
        Park' had been expanded</a> to take many employees of motorway
        constructors.&nbsp; A lad who lived at the park just threw a cigarette butt onto
        the thatched roof - heaven knows what precisely had motivated him. &nbsp; The
        unfolding incident was
        particularly harrowing because the fire brigade brought the fire quickly
        under control and, after hours of damping down, then departed.&nbsp; The fire,
        however, rekindled and totally destroyed the upper part of the building.
        <p>One onlooker remembers helping to get the landlord's possessions out
        of their tiny home above the pub, down narrow stairs. &quot;And we never
        smashed one ornament&quot;.</p>

      <td width="349" height="510"><b>16-20 </b>At some point in the 18th
        century the rector had his coach house at this corner in the High
        Street.&nbsp; The sharpness of the corner was not exceptional (compare
        Deddington, Oxon. or Kimbolton, Hunt.) but in 1841 the rectory was re-built
        and with it an even more imposing coach-house was built making the
        corner even more blind.&nbsp; It's photographed here in about
        1958.&nbsp; In c. 1964 the stone from the coach-house demolition was used in the
        fore-garden of the rectory to raise levels and the road was
        straightened somewhat.&nbsp; The old line of the road is preserved as a
        lay-by or service road running next to the Sun, Moon and Stars building.
        <p>In fairness to the 19th century rector, there was a 1812 plan to
        extend a new road in a straight line from West Bridge (the Mill Bridge) to
        the railway arch, straight across the front of the Sun, Moon &amp;
        Stars. In 1835 this by-pass was again tabled as a means to link up with
        the coming of the railway station at the arch with a coach-house or
        toll-house there.&nbsp; The kink in the High Street would have then evolved
        into a Tee junction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such plans would have provided the village with
        its by-pass and a basis for a much improved village layout in the 20th
        century (see <a href="Bypass&#32;History.htm">the bypass section</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a mystery why the scheme was never put

        built on such a slope.&nbsp; There are more pictures of the coach house
        at the end of the <a href="Westbridge.htm">West Bridge</a> section.<p>The supposed Roman path to a lookout on Gayton Hill
        (see the book &quot;Blisworth&quot; by Tony Marsh, 2004) is aligned with
        the church tower and therefore would appear as a vertical
        line in this picture - it would be between the <i><b>a</b></i> and <b><i>g</i></b> of the
        watermark running through the corner of a nearby small field and
        adjacent to the Sun, Moon &amp; Stars Inn.</p>

        <p>And this shot shows the result of removing the coach house and
        re-profiling the ground.&nbsp; Includes a rare picture of the lime trees
        in the cemetery in a state of heavy pollarding.&nbsp; See <a href="Westbridge.htm">West
        Bridge</a> section.</p>
        <p>At the time of the road re-profiling the Rector was the Rev.
        Bunker.&nbsp; The large slice of earth that was effectively taken from
        the 'mound' on which the church and vicarage are built was apparently
        the subject of some controversy in the village - the name used to refer
        to this was &quot;The Battle of Bunker's Hill&quot; (with thanks to John
        Whitehead for that gem!).</p>
