        the stationmaster was accommodated in one of the two villas at the
        Northampton Road end of Station Road.&nbsp; The various sheds in the
        field were agricultural.&nbsp; The bungalow was
        used to house Belgian refugees in the late 1930s.&nbsp;It was built by
        the Griffith family in 1927/8 and demolished in about 1984 by Peter Griffith who
        then built the bungalow that now stands there (early 2000s). On the skyline
        above the bungalow is the railway goods-shed.</p>

      Designed by J. Shearman, who worked for the LMS
      railway, this vehicle was a hybrid single decker bus, built by Karrier Motors of Huddersfield with a Craven body,
      equipped with both tyres and flanged steel wheels.&nbsp; It was put into use in early
      1932 and worked on the rails between Blisworth and Stratford Goods Yard on
      the SMJ line.&nbsp; The different pairs of wheels were exchanged using levers
      that were stored inside. The levers were used at each axle in a manner
      presently available on line*&nbsp; From the goods yard it made its way through the streets of Stratford to the Welcome
      Hotel.&nbsp; The service was discontinued after only a few months.</p>

      likely to be at the Northampton depot where they would have been routinely
      serviced.
      <p>&nbsp;L.N.W.R. men displayed a fierce loyalty to their railway as can
      be detected in the group proudly posing around the loco - the group

      <p>Removal of rails took hold from 1961 onwards yet RTH were still using the
      northerly 1/4 mile section of the SMJ line in order to continue delivery,
      until 1967, of ironstone at the long parallel sidings just a few 100 yards north of
      where this picture was taken.</p>
      <p>The gauges of the mineral railways and
      the national railways was the same.&nbsp; Once the SMJ line was
      non-existent to the south, engineers lifted some track near the sidings
      and made a more or less permanent link with BR.&nbsp; This was illegal but
      it saved time messing about at the sidings.&nbsp; I suppose there was the
      risk of a runaway train of wagons hurtling into the closed Blisworth
      Station, demolishing the SMJ buffers and coming to a stop in front of
      the hotel. (see Tonks)</p>

        we learn from one of them, who shall be anonymous, they sometimes had a

        costumes which tempted two of them to don a stage donkey with flashing
        eyes, but alas no batteries, and prance up and down the main platform as
        the drivers of the through expresses took their double-take.&nbsp;
        Mainly it was heavy work, there being practically no limit to the weight
        of a parcel consigned by railway - rolls of lino, gas cylinders and
