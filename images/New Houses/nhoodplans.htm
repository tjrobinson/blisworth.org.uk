        article was posted in November 2011 in anticipation of the debate on
        the<br>
        subject of &quot;Neighbourhood Planning&quot;.&nbsp; On Feb 7th 2012 in
        a Parish Council<br>
        meeting a discussion on this was triggered by an informal talk given by
        Ms. Milner<br>
        from ACRE.&nbsp; It was revealed that neighbourhood plans worked up to a
        full legal<br>
        status may cost from £17000 to £63000 and indeed provide the village
        with a<br>
        control over the nature of development.&nbsp; What the set up could not
        be permitted<br>
        to do was to place an obstacle in the way of development - central and
        local<br>
        government have total &quot;control&quot; over that.&nbsp; For many, the
        expense and the<br>
        relatively toothless feature of a neighbourhood plan renders it
        unattractive.&nbsp; The<br>
        idea of including adjacent fields as visual amenity (see below*) in the
        plans may<br>

      It
      appears we are invited to designate neighbourhoods and then, at certain
      stages in the future, exercise our right to be the planning authority.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p></o:p>At least so much is certain but the following notes and
      suggestions are a result of a reading of documents at the abovementioned
      website.&nbsp; Some of this may be incorrect.&nbsp; SNC has recently
      published a guide and protocol for neighbourhood plans and you can <a href="Cabinet_Neighbourhood_Planning_Protocol.doc">download
      it here</a>.&nbsp; It must be borne in mind that any plan must comply with
      the terms of the local strategic plan ie. if such plan stipulates a
      certain growth in housing for this area then our plan has to agree with
      that.</span>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">There
      seems little point in our just having one neighbourhood, we can take advantage of the
      various natural differences in parts of the village and create a small
      number of neighbourhoods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; *</span>It seems that we really need to include all contiguous fields around
      the village into our neighbourhoods so that we can have a say in their future
      development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>We can legitimately refer to them as the visual amenity (primarily) associated
      with each of the neighborhoods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      However, the <b>SNC</b> has re-stated the reminder that the village Confines
      Boundaries will be reviewed soon and this may cut across our desire to
      preserve visual amenity.&nbsp; </span>The Googled map of the village
      below gives you one suggestion for the neighbourhoods – please don’t
      get hung up on the details of these boundaries at this stage.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">Thus,
      purely (and this adverb cannot be over-emphasised)as examples, there are outlined three neighbourhoods including the nearby fields
      plus a &quot;rural neighbourhood&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>These are outlined in red as follows:<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <b>CENTRAL</b> - High Street, Towcester Road and Towns End<br>
      <b>SOUTH-EAST</b> - Ladyfield, 1938-9, 1950s and 1960s Builds<br>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">For the Central neighbourhood
      most of the houses are Victorian or of earlier vintage and the boundaries
      are conveniently aligned with much of the boundaries of Blisworth's
      Conservation Area.&nbsp; The fourth neighbourhood includes all single
      houses and clusters of houses that are substantially encircled by
      fields.&nbsp; This is a convenient way to insure that the entire parish is
      included with
      its large cluster (The Arm), small clusters (Station Road, Railway
      Cottages and Pynus Cottages), industrial groupings which include dwellings
      and offices (Northampton Road Complex, Blisworth Hill Farm, etc) and the
      large number of single dwellings inc. farm houses.&nbsp; <span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Our
      village's “Neighbourhood Plan”, which can be a version of our Village Design
      Statement (written originally in March 2011 having arisen from the actions
      on the Blisworth <a href="../Complan/plan.htm#detail">Community Plan</a>,
      2009 - 2011), shall have to be constructed
      so that it will do various things that will satisfy “an official
      examination” of the document.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This</span> aspect
      is left out for the present – please suppose &quot;the plan&quot; is written
      and it
      has passed the examiner who has the satisfaction of knowing we are a
      &quot;capable&quot; group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; With it, we
      will</span> have described and registered our neighbourhoods on the basis of our
      opinions about them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Apparently, we
      need to be &quot;rigorous&quot; in our account.&nbsp; We will probably say that almost any housing
      development, apart from in-filling, would spoil visual amenity or hamper traffic in the
      village.&nbsp; However, with care there might be small pockets that may be
      developed with a benefit to the village given simultaneous improvement to
      the highways.&nbsp; </span>It's hoped that the idea is conveyed: all the agreed policy bits and pieces
      we feel are desirable can get folded into the definition of our
      neighbourhoods.<o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">Aspects
      envisaged in going forward and using the neighbourhood plan will, at least, include the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Parish Council appears to be promised an early involvement when a new and fairly major development is to be proposed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The council would be informed of its existence and its detailed
      description.<o:p>
      </o:p>  The council then has 28 days in which to “<i>determine</i>”
      that neighbourhood
      in which the development is to be located.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Or they can decide not to <i> determine</i> the neighbourhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Our language is
      rich, so goodness knows why the mandarins picked their buzzword <i>determine</i> instead of, let’s say,
      <i>classify, inclose </i>or
      <i> confine</i>)<o:p>.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">2</span></font><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      An operational code for the Parish Council may then be as follows:&nbsp; </span>If
      the neighbourhood is left <i>un-determined</i> then the <b>SNC</b> will manage
      the planning in the age-old way and we would decide this option if we basically approve the
      plan and feel that we can obtain enough adjustment in the details by
      processes akin to what we are familiar with.<o:p>&nbsp; </font></span><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">If,
      however, we decide to <i>determine</i> then we will be made the planning authority on
      this occasion, for this neighbourhood.&nbsp; One catchy phrase is &quot;we
      will be in the driving seat&quot; and the advantages of that will be
      that the Parish Council will have first hand dealings with any problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Being the planning authority may allow the Parish Council to co-opt a case officer
      from the <b> SNC</b> to help frame our actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      would be rather wonderful in principle.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      In any case there are four organisations available to give the Council some
      help.</span></font></p>

      Many
      questions will arise in the next few months.&nbsp; Let us be optimistic
      and hope that this is the first real opportunity that there has been for
      villagers to control planning - this is assuming that the &quot;Localism
      Bill&quot; succeeds through Parliament.&nbsp; This document serves as a
      &quot;heads-up&quot;

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">That
      last sentiment takes us naturally to the next point.&nbsp; Here is an
      extract from <i>The Independent</i></span></font>,<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#000080">
      Sunday 13th November 2011, in an article about another example of
      &quot;Localism&quot; in action:&nbsp; <i>One million state workers are to
      be transferred out of hospitals, colleges and job centres as part of David
      Cameron's &quot;aggressive aspiration&quot; to create John Lewis-mutual
      style public services. With little fanfare, services across the country
      are being quietly taken over by their own staff - state funded but run
      independently. The Prime Minister claims the number of services that adopt
      the scheme will be a key test of his Big Society vision. This is all just
      the mechanics under the car bonnet to make the car work better. </i>(Of
      course, the motoring analogy means our politician is being 'frank' and
      hopes few will consider themselves competent to look under any bonnet, Ed.)&nbsp;
      <i>What has been created here is a new freedom, in which staff or <b>a voluntary organisation</b> </i> (ed's. use of bold)<i>
      may run a service.&nbsp; These 'mutuals' put staff in the driving seat etc. etc.....</i></font></span></p>

      benefit<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">?&nbsp; We
