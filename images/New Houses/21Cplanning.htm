        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080"><b>Abstract:&nbsp;</b>This
        deals mainly with two major housing planning matters that were imposed
        on the village. An account is given of the major difficulties
        encountered by some in the village but mainly the Parish Council.&nbsp;
        There was potential for the character of the village to be changed in an
        adverse way because the proposed housing numbers were quite high.&nbsp; In this
        period, however, the total housing increase was only 33 units, mostly to
        be placed on a new estate adjoining Chapel Lane.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;It is
        pointed out that there are lessons to be learnt in dealing with planners
        and developers.<br>
        At various times, both in letters written and in this document, use is
        made of phrases such as &quot;poor design&quot; or &quot;dangerous&quot;
        in expressing a layman's opinion and dissatisfaction.&nbsp; Use of such
        words makes a point based on layman's opinion without calling into question either the
        professional's ability or his integrity and recalls the various discussions that
        actually took place.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">This account is given from
        the perspective of a member of the public listening to the Blisworth
        Parish Council (<b>PC</b>) sessions, sometimes asking questions
        afterwards and sometimes writing to <b> SNC</b> officials to try and clarify matters or
        just to express a view.&nbsp; In the early months of the time period
        mentioned above, there arose three big issues - see <b>A</b>, <b> B</b> and
        <b> C</b> below.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080"><b>(A).</b>&nbsp;<b>Affordable
        Social Housing.</b>&nbsp; In 2009 the village was
        surveyed by <b>SNC</b> for the need of more social housing.&nbsp; This was in response to
        an approach by <b>SNC</b>  in August 2009 and there was agreement around
        November, without vote, that
        such survey would be a good idea.&nbsp; The result which has been
        published was that some 34 houses were required, mostly of a
        single-occupancy or small family type, and the <b>PC</b> agreed to this.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080"><b>(B).&nbsp;SNC Village
        Enlargement Edict.</b>&nbsp; Also in 2009, the <b>SNC</b> were put under pressure,
        from roughly March 2009 onwards, to
        speedily allocate and proceed with the building of extra dwellings in
        about 17 Northamptonshire villages otherwise they would be deemed
        somewhat tardy in the execution of what was required of them - or words to that effect,
        the author not
        wishing to enter a legalistic discussion here.&nbsp; Their survey for
        the extra dwellings resulted in a notional 40 houses being suggested for
        Blisworth, corresponding to 5% of dwellings within the village.&nbsp; The
        decision was based upon the sustainability of an implied enlargement of
        the village.&nbsp; The reasoning for it has been published - the
        decision was <b>SNC</b>'s with no discussions with any <b>PC </b>in the
        county.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The majority of villagers
        probably accepted both of these pressures - &quot;what
        must be, must be&quot;.&nbsp; Actually, the social housing project <i>could
        have been</i> refused by the <b>PC</b>.&nbsp; Regarding the numbers, the 34
        in <b>(A)</b> is approximate in the
        sense that demand fluctuates and the survey was a snapshot.&nbsp; The 40
        in <b>(B)</b> is notional and might be lower or considerably higher though few people
        who are probably in touch with such matters doubt the number would
        exceed 70.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We have been advised that the above-mentioned approximate 34 and the notional 40
        may be simply merged
        rather than added together - an important point.&nbsp; All <u> infill</u> building going on or agreed
        in Blisworth has no bearing whatsoever on these allocations.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080"><b>(C).&nbsp; A Planning
        Application - Chapel Hill Farm Development.</b>&nbsp; The third issue
        was an outline planning application to the <b>SNC</b> lodged in October 2009 by an outside developer,
        to create a
        modest sized cluster of variously sized houses, 27 in all, 11 of which
        would be properly managed social houses.&nbsp; This application for
        development is located to the north of Chapel Lane on Chapel Hill Farm.&nbsp; If this were
        granted there would still be ~23 social houses needed somewhere else and that
        23 along with the 27 in the application would exceed and therefore satisfy the call for
        a village enlargement by 40 houses.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">To chronicle the series of
        events on these three topics in a combined chronological order would generate a
        complex story, consequently they are discussed separately in what
        follows.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The
        need for affordable social housing:</b>&nbsp; In Nov/Dec 2009 the <b>PC</b> and
        an <b>SNC</b>
        housing representative conducted a walkabout in the village to discuss various empty fields, in
        search of the land for the 34 social houses, and
        some preliminary findings were fed back to a public <b> PC</b> meeting.&nbsp;
        The possible sites which were
        put forward during the village walkabout are shown in
        white in the map below, <b>A</b> through <b>G</b>.&nbsp; Shown also, in yellow, is the
        proposed Chapel Hill Farm development which is discussed below.&nbsp; Favoured sites were <b> B</b> and <b> D</b> with <b>C,</b>
        the others being too remote from the village centre.&nbsp;
        Site <b> B</b>  had meanwhile been earmarked as open space (because of
        the adjacent proposed development).&nbsp; So the
        remaining social
        housing needs had to be accommodated on <b> D</b> with
        <b>C</b>.&nbsp; That is a dearth of options indeed - this was the impression
        gained around April/May 2010.&nbsp; What ever is suggested
        might be influenced by a rather new policy for housing estate design,
        that is; to achieve a &quot;tenure-blind layout&quot; so that social
        housing cannot be readily segregated in anyone's mind, 40% of the houses
        would be 'social' and sprinkled amongst 'free-market'.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="plots.jpg" width="500" height="315"><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In
        May the <b>SNC</b> made a presentation to the <b>PC</b> expressing the
        intention to occupy area <b>C</b>, only, with a proposed six rentable
        housing units for family sizes of up to 3, 4 and 5 persons and made a key
        point in saying the units would have their own separate entrances
        (hinting that single person flats are wasteful and less easily
        designed).&nbsp; They
        dismissed the <b>PC</b>'s objections that such houses were not
        consistent with the housing needs survey by saying that the architect
        was constrained by the size and shape of the small plot available.&nbsp;
        The point was made in subsequent discussions that the <b>SNC</b> were
        holding back on proposing any more social houses, to fill the previously
        required 34, because of the
        anticipated financial difficulties.&nbsp; There was a formal planning
        application in June and the <b>PC</b> formally objected to it in early
        July.&nbsp; By 20th July the application had however been withdrawn by <b>SNC
        </b>but replaced with a new application a few weeks later with the
        explanation that the design was wrong in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again
        the <b>PC</b> formally objected to it for reasons of not providing the
        housing indicated as needed in the survey.&nbsp; They also pointed out
        the out-of-date design of the exit to Ladyfield, in terms of visibility, and
        pointed out the invited hazard arising from an increase in the number of
        vehicles using the exit.&nbsp; The new houses also appeared incongruous.&nbsp;
        By the end of September 2010 full approval was granted - parish council
        objections overridden.</font><p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30; padding-right: 30"><font color="#000080">Incidentally</font><font color="#000080">,
        with
        area <b>C</b>
        used up for housing, the only realistic prospect of the village
        having a school car park is eliminated. Note that there was a proposal for a school car park on area <b>C</b>
        generated by a villager in October 2009 and an account of the
        difficulties encountered with that proposal are given in Appendix <b>I</b>.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>The
        Need for Village Enlargement - including the Planning Application.</b>&nbsp;
        Obviously the village walkabout equipped the <b>PC</b> with ideas for
        accommodating the enforced village enlargement.&nbsp; However, the focus
        became the planning
        application.&nbsp; Any emphasis on achieving the right numbers <i>seems</i> to have disappeared since
        then, perhaps because
        of possible financial constraints for servicing more houses.&nbsp; The
        development proposed in October 2009 was for 27 houses on a new road
        headed north from Chapel Lane.&nbsp; The layout is shown in the figure
        below.&nbsp; Note that the area encircled in blue is held by the same
        owners and that, for some curious reason, the new development is drawn
        30 or 40 metres short of the northern limit of the field.&nbsp;</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="chapelhill.jpg" width="450" height="482"><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The
        application was initially in outline and it transpired that this was
        because various assessments had not been completed (eg. flood
        risk).&nbsp; The <b> PC</b> was initially ill-equipped to deal with topics of
        this magnitude but eventually recovered.&nbsp; It objected to the plan
        mainly for these reasons:</font><p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080"><b>1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        builder's traffic would choke the village and it should be admitted only
        via a temporary entrance created at <b>BA</b> on the Northampton Road.<br>
        <b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the junction is dangerous because the grade of Chapel Lane at
        that point is 17% (1 in 6).<br>
        <b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the junction is dangerous for pedestrians who were expected to
        first proceed west upon emerging from the estate before crossing the
        Chapel Lane to find a pavement.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><a name="scheme"></a>At
        a housing development meeting one objector for the <b>PC</b> was allowed
        3 minutes to make representation (the standard provision), and one
        objector from the village also - 3 minutes.&nbsp; Between them the above
        objections were made.</font><font color="#A60B9A">&nbsp; Also included was the suggestion that the
        temporary entrance for lorries etc. be made permanent instead and that the estate
        road should not come out onto Chapel Lane at all.&nbsp; Furthermore it
        was suggested that a pedestrian and
        cycle pathway be created, as <b>A</b> in the diagram above, to join
        Little Lane.&nbsp; There
        would be an extra stretch of estate road <b>X</b> in this plan and that
        could accommodate the rest of the village enlargement, both <b>(A)</b>
        and <b>(B)</b>.&nbsp; This 'wonderful scheme', which will be recalled in a
        review below, would have killed a few birds with one stone but, as
        viewed from the Gayton Road, it would have more obviously signalled a
        village enlargement.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The
        temporary lorry access was granted but in the opinion of the <b>NCC</b>
        Highways department the junction with Chapel Lane was perfectly safe in
        regard to both traffic and pedestrians (the 30mph limit sign would be
        relocated near the canal bridge) and <b>SNC</b> will not challenge the judgment
        of&nbsp; the <b>NCC</b>
        highways department, whom they treat as key consultants.&nbsp; An enlargement of the project to
        encompass the major change of access and
        the pathway to Little Lane was deemed inadmissible.&nbsp; Apparently, this is
        because one cannot object and propose <u> extensive additions</u> that are
        based on aspects that are, <u> in an objector's opinion, omissions</u> from the plan.&nbsp; Anyway, as part of the <b>SNC</b> plan, the rest of the
        field was previously set as green open space.&nbsp; Subsequently a
        letter was written by an incandescent villager demanding that
        consideration be given to a new pavement at <b>P</b> on the north side
        of Chapel Lane to make things safer for pedestrians, this being an idea
        picked up later.</font>
        <p><img src="path.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="141">
        <font color="#000080">At
        the June 2010 <b>PC</b> meeting it was made plain by <b>SNC</b>   that their attitude
        was going to be inflexible and that no
        further improvements to the scheme would be granted.&nbsp; Parish
        councillors were admonished for trying to second guess the technical
        assessments by engineers in the <b> NCC</b> Highways Department.&nbsp;
        Furthermore, all the &quot;106 contribution&quot; (this topic is discussed in the
        summary below) would be used up
        in providing the temporary access road,
        moving the 30mph sign and rendering the original site fit for housing
        after the hazards from farm sheds and sewage cesspool receptacles had
        been cleared.&nbsp; This comment was seen by many to
        demonstrate <b>SNC</b>'s misuse of the 106 provision.&nbsp; By this time the <b>PC</b> had
        awakened somewhat and selected an
        action team to deal with planning and, armed with photographic evidence,
        this team asked for further consultation and demanded, among other things,
        a new 'north' pavement for pedestrian access (shown in pink in the
        inset) to obviate the need for a dangerous pedestrian route
        suggested by the red arrows.&nbsp; Luckily, perhaps, the decision process had been halted
        as <b>SNC</b>  was waiting for the outcome of &quot;a fluctuating and
        unclear policy framework&quot; in relation to calculating <b>SNC</b> housing
        needs, this being a planning
        upheaval, affecting how their &quot;Enlargement Edict&quot; would be played
        out, induced by a local government lawyer (Eric Pickles - later the
        Community Minister).&nbsp; The
        background politics are outside the scope of this account.&nbsp; A decision date was set for 15th July
        and later extended to merely an estimated time around early
        October.&nbsp;
        The consultation opportunity between <b>PC</b> and <b>SNC</b> was duly granted for Sept 7th,
        at which <b>SNC</b> pointed out that the <b>PC</b>
        'action team' were too late with their input and anyway, as much of it
        related to highways, <b>SNC</b> were not empowered to respond.&nbsp;
        However
        they promised to open the topic again with &quot;Highways&quot; with a
        view to maybe revise the 106 list. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">What transpired came as a surprise: the developer
        agreed to late changes and the <b> NCC</b> Highways finally conceded that a footpath
        (presumably on the
        lines of the inset schematic above) <b> would be included in the project</b> - a
        revised legal agreement was drawn up with the developer to accommodate
        the changes.&nbsp; The reader might wish to compare this position with that described in the first two
        sentences of the previous paragraph and wonder <i>&quot;why is the job done so
        inefficiently; why so much blood,
        sweat and tears?&quot;</i>&nbsp; With 'policy framework' resolved, the planning application was given approval by <b>SNC</b>
        in 'outline' on Nov 29th 2010, nearly 14 months after it was first lodged.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Execution of this village development was
        delayed by a spectacular amount of time in which 'nothing has been
        heard', see below, and it has been noticed in the meantime that the
        private driveway to the house adjacent to the junction had not been
        shifted as indicated in the above inset diagram (curved blue arrow).
        This would result in a pavement drop-kerb being sited nearer to a road
        junction than the approved 10 metres and <b>NCC</b> were informed of
        this apparent faux-pas on November 10th 2012.&nbsp; Villagers thought it
        important to mention this so that the issue could not be later used as
        an excuse to 'delete' the north-side pavement - we will see!<a name="matchbox"></a></font></p>
        <p><img src="matchbox.jpg" align="left" width="371" height="180">
        <font color="#000080">This development will provide Blisworth with 27
        new houses of which 11 will be &quot;affordable&quot; and will be
        rentable and managed by South Northamptonshire Homes.&nbsp; With the 6
        granted in Ladyfield there will be a total of 17 rentable houses but perhaps the more austere
        financial circumstances will leave the <b>SNC</b> satisfied that this amounts
        to only 50% of their target deduced from the survey.&nbsp; The 16 other
        houses to be built at Chapel Hill Farm amount to far less than the
        notional 40 arrived at by <b> SNC</b> originally but, apparently, some other
        villages in South Northamptonshire have incurred &quot;larger than
        expected&quot; building projects.&nbsp; The inset conveys an idea, in
        fact a mock up image presented on the architects' website, of what our 27 new houses may look
        like (there are <a href="matchbox01.jpg">more images</a>).&nbsp;
        It is to be hoped that the architects will rename themselves something a
        little less mocking of their intended end-users.</font></p>

        <i>Be in touch with the &quot;process&quot; and act swiftly and
        decisively.</i>&nbsp; This is advice primarily for the Parish Council.&nbsp;
        But with our present council, some members, some training for this objective must start at
        &quot;square one&quot;.&nbsp; In the &quot;affordable houses&quot;
        activity the <b> PC</b> should have insisted on receiving,
        before agreeing a survey would be made, a <u> written</u> undertaking
        that the houses that would eventually be pushed through would comply
        with those the village's housing needs.&nbsp; And when the first
        layout was presented, in which the needs were obviously not going to be heeded,
        the <b> PC</b> should not have been satisfied with the reply to the effect that
        the architect had little scope to do otherwise.&nbsp; In the &quot;27
        new houses&quot; activity the <b> PC</b> was incapable of straightaway creating an
        agenda for what needed to be done, indeed, one month later, they were
        overtly embarrassed by
        their lack of progress and resolved to hold future
        &quot;serious&quot; discussions in camera to avoid any further
        embarrassment.&nbsp; It was many weeks later still that a four man action team
        was assembled to deal with the planners and so one lesson was learnt on
        the fly.&nbsp; Delays in the <b>PC</b>'s response were quoted as the reason
        that items to be included in the 106 agreement were left out at
        first.&nbsp; The <b>SNC</b> chose to ignore letters, that would have
        been &quot;well in time&quot; from at least one resident.&nbsp; They
        appear to imply that only communications from a <b>PC</b>  are
        acceptable.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080"><b>2.</b>&nbsp;
        <i>Insist on a change in the process.</i>&nbsp; This is a heavy-weight
        political matter.&nbsp; In the &quot;27 new houses&quot; activity it is
        a fact that 3 months before the outline planning application was
        launched, a senior at <b> SNC</b> mentioned that a major project was
        &quot;coming our way&quot;.&nbsp; It was identified as having a measure of &quot;planning
        gain&quot;, alluding to the use of land which would be improved
        etc.&nbsp; Clearly the project was the Chapel Hill Farm development.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080">Then would have been the time for an action team within our <b>
        PC</b> to hold confidential discussions with the planners.&nbsp; Both sides
        could then assess the relevance of an enhancement to the plan such as
        mentioned above in an enhanced colour (<a href="21Cplanning.htm#scheme">click here to go there</a>, and then
        the <u> back button</u> to return here).&nbsp; Both could appreciate the
        validity of the assertion that there was a poorly specified
        junction between the estate road and Chapel Lane and moves could have
        been made then to request, at least, the extra footpath.&nbsp; Both
        would have realised that there was a need for builders' traffic to enter
        the building site by a route that avoided Chapel Lane - and so on and
        on.&nbsp; In this way the 106 agreement would have been drafted
        accurately and
        would have needed little blood, sweat and tears later.&nbsp; However,
        given denial of any political change that would allow the <b> PC</b> this earlier access, the 106 agreement
        process seems to be just a way of adding things that were overlooked in
        the first place; the process being charged with anxiety in that it has to be done efficiently and speedily
        as it is all against the clock.&nbsp; These agreements also seem to be
        seen as something of a last-minute imposition on the developer and not on service
        providers, limited in scope at
        the outset (by rules): all this rather than an <u>encouraged right</u> for
        villagers to improve on what has been proposed by planners.&nbsp;
        Frankly, the situation seems inadequate.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 77; padding-right: 77"><font color="#000080"><b>3.</b>&nbsp;

        </b>The two housing projects referred to above were thought to be
        progressed in 2011 with the work possibly running into 2012.&nbsp; By
        February 2011 however, the small Ladyfield project was still believed to
        be going ahead but there was a persistent rumour that the Chapel Hill
        Farm estate of 27 houses, after all, might not be the subject of a <i>full</i>
        planning application.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><font color="#000080">The year 2011 has been given as
        the year in which the village confines boundaries will be revised.&nbsp;
        This will give us all a good idea of the authorities' intentions
        regarding enlargement of the village.&nbsp; A developer was already
        looking, in November 2010, at the prospect of
        building maybe as many as 100 houses on the southern boundary of the
        village.&nbsp; The <a href="../Complan/plan.htm#detail">Community
        Management Plan</a> was published eventually in 2011.&nbsp; Any village
        attitude to development was rather muted.&nbsp; The organisers had
        switched their planned path to writing a Village Design Statement (<b>VDS</b>)
        in which the issue of development will be central.&nbsp; The year 2012
        has been labelled as seeing the emergence of a <b>VDS</b>.&nbsp; There
        is no surprise here - dealing with planners always has the
        &quot;paper-chase&quot; element.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><font color="#000080"><b>2012</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Amazingly, the greater part of 2012 has passed us by without any news on
        when the 27 houses on Chapel Hill Farm will be started. The site has
        been cleared however. The work on a <b>VDS</b> was stalled when
        government goalposts were again moved as they called for a &quot;neighbourhood
        plan&quot; instead.&nbsp; Some villagers responded to that with initial
        enthusiasm but everyone's interest faded out during 2012.&nbsp; The next
        &quot;big deal&quot; for Blisworth will probably be when the <b>SNC</b>
        decide on new Confines Boundaries and whether they will include that
        next door field across which the contractors for this project have been
        so seemingly reluctant to cross.</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><font color="#000080"><b>2013</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Blisworth School Car Park</b></font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Some within the
        village had identified site <b> C</b> as best used as a car park for the
        school.&nbsp; This idea was brought out at the &quot;Have your Say&quot;
        day held 10 October 2009 to identify village needs and design the
        questionnaire for the village <a href="../Complan/plan.htm"> Community
        Plan</a>.&nbsp; The idea of a
        village school car park was received very well indeed.&nbsp; So well, in
        fact, that the school governors were expected to come forward with a
        pressure group that would talk to the <b>SNC</b>.&nbsp; The nub of the
        car park idea is set out in the diagram below.</font>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="project.jpg" width="600" height="427"><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">As
        time passed, however, it
        turned out that little action had been taken; neither the <b>SNC</b> nor the <b>PC</b>
        were lobbied (except by one villager) at all, though by the end of January 2010
        a school governor was
        expected to write to the <b>SNC</b>.&nbsp; There are only 4 governors
        from the village out of a total of 17.&nbsp; Many people
        just muttered that the <b>SNC</b> would do what they liked and there was
        no point to this.&nbsp; Other villagers remarked that, even if built, the use of the car
        park could not be enforced - it would make no difference to traffic
        congestion in the village and some thought it was not near enough to the
        school and was too bothersome to use.&nbsp; The <b> PC</b> simply said at one point
        that site <b> C</b> was earmarked by <b>SNC</b> for
        housing units, taking this with a characteristic lassitude as a 'knockout blow' against any further
        discussion.&nbsp; In fact they were right, of course!</font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">In separate
        interviews, the head of strategic planning at <b>SNC</b> said that the
        car park plan would be far too expensive in relation to the number of houses
        that might be considered.&nbsp;
        However, someone
        working on strategic housing undertook to raise this as an issue at an
        appropriate time but thought that by far the best idea would be to approach
        the owner of the land involved and this was given some serious
        consideration.&nbsp;In June/July 2010 the <b>SNC</b>  had started to
        consider developing site <b>C</b> so it appeared unlikely they will allow
        a car park there.&nbsp; As stated above, area <b>D</b> appears to be the
        obvious new development site to which an application for a car park
        might be attached.&nbsp; The year 2011 was the year for
        revising the confines boundaries and this might trigger a new development, without
        invoking special conditions, that could &quot;carry the car park
        proposal with it&quot;.&nbsp; However, the longer walk to/from it may be too
        far and a consequence may be that all residual interest in it will die
        off.&nbsp; Interestingly, the plan offered above suggests how access to
        new housing might be designed.</font>
