        <p align="center">The original site was outlined by 1838 and, in the
        late Victorian century, a group of three houses were established in the
        Church Lane - High Street corner of the site.&nbsp; The architecture of
        these three (known as 'The Gables' at one time, numbers 27, 29 and 31
        High Street) follows that of many
        cottages designed by the Duchess of Grafton that were built throughout
        the estate.&nbsp; There are a number of groups of 'Grafton' cottages
        with their distinctively tiled roofs in the village - however, none are
        listed.&nbsp; This project includes the renovation and enlargement of
        the two more easterly units in the group, numbers 27 and 29, and the establishment of two
        new large houses in their grounds.&nbsp; Being an extension of existing
        Victorian architecture near to both the Church and many listed
        buildings in the High Street, and being adjacent to a listed house in
        Church Lane, it is thought appropriate to record some
        details here, including comments if any are received.&nbsp;

        nos. 27, 29 and 31, from the High Street January 2006 and May 2006.&nbsp;
        Doorway to No. 27 is green and that of No. 29 is blue.&nbsp; These are
        the two houses, with much that was disintegrating, that were to be refurbished.&nbsp; A visitor to the village in 2005
        remarked that perhaps the house was haunted as it appeared so
        neglected.&nbsp; Indeed it was neglected for years, both houses owned by
        one man who eventually died. It took months for the remaining family to
        sort out ownership and sell the houses to a developer - Mr. Colin
        Clayson.
        <p align="center">The houses were built in around 1875 by the Duke of Grafton.&nbsp;
        The design was set out by the Duchess of Grafton and is characterised by
        a decoratively layered roof and regular layers in the walls of ironstone
        to blend with the various layered designs elsewhere in the
        village.&nbsp; The design was preserved during the refurbishment and
        reproduced in the two new houses built in the grounds off Church Lane.
        <p align="center">There are two pieces of history recorded on this website which refers to the
        houses: (i) the Police House or <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/New%20Houses/Articles/Law_and_order.htm">Police
        Station</a> was once at number 29 and (ii) a member of the <a href="http://www.blisworth.org.uk/images/New%20Houses/whitlock.htm">Whitlock
        family</a>, namely William &quot;Clocky&quot; Whitlock (1836 - 1905) - Church
        sexton,
        carpenter and clockmaker,
        once occupied number 31 which was called Rose Cottage at the time.</td>

        <p align="center">A similar panoramic view taken in February 2007.&nbsp;
        The plot was then ready for earthmoving machines, having established the
        location of the driveway which was to eventually serve all four
        houses.&nbsp; With the site cleared it became possible to view the row
        of houses in the High Street and for their occupants to view the
        Church.&nbsp; However, these views would soon disappear for ever!
        <p align="center">The remaining pictures presented here show the finished
        layout which certainly follows the Victorian architecture though with
        some disregard for harmony in dormer window designs.&nbsp; The
        disparate levels on the site have obviously been a nuisance as; they have given
        'birth' to a number of high boundary walls, there is a markedly high elevation
        presented to the High Street and future residents seem deprived of sufficient garage space and
        ideal spaces for parked vehicles.&nbsp; All of this is perhaps minor when one
        realises just how poorly-arranged some developments can turn out to
        be.&nbsp; The standards of exterior stone work and brickwork are
        excellent and the interiors are said to be very attractive.</td>
