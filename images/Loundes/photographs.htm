        barge-boarding decoration has been restored since the 1960s.&nbsp; The house was built in

        with strange perspective, perhaps because of the unusual shape of the
        rear gable - see inset, being a plan of the building dated c.
        1850.&nbsp;</font></td>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Blisworth Church and &quot;The
        Cross&quot; (</b>c. 1880 -
        see below<b>)</b>&nbsp; The picture is taken
        from a rather standard place but, because it extends well towards
        the right, it gives us a view of the &quot;Cross&quot; monument which
        has been, up to now, shown to us
        only in <a href="../Church-Images2.htm#cross">one of George Clarke's
        etching</a>.&nbsp; The picture is therefore unique. On being shown it, <a href="../Barnwell/Barnwell-paper.htm">Paul
        Barnwell</a> (formerly at English Heritage) comments: &quot;The
        structure has an exceptionally slender shaft, which makes one think of a
        timber pole - i.e. of something temporary.&nbsp; On record is the fact
        that
        at some point before 1843 a sundial was erected on the base; and that it
        had disappeared by 1895. (C. Markham, 'The stone crosses of the County
        of Northampton', Associated Architectural Societies Reports and Papers,
        23 part&nbsp; 1 (1895), p. 163). Perhaps that is what the picture shows
        - a very long gnomon with an ornamental top, with its shadow being read
        off a dial which was laid out on top of the stone base.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We now know that <i>Wetton's Guide to Northampton and its Vicinity</i>
        mentions the &quot;cross with five ascents, on which there is a wooden
        cross and a sundial dated 1827&quot;.&nbsp; The sundial etc. was
        created, surprisingly, but perhaps not originally, during the time Rev.
        Ambrosse was in charge (yet probably absent - see <a href="../Church/GFChurchnotes.htm">GF
        Church Notes</a>).&nbsp; Incidently the Northampton Mercury reports an exceptional gale on March 24, 1895 which
        broke off large pieces from the elm trees in the church yard and perhaps
        brought an end to the supposed gnomon though the actual <a href="1895&#32;gales.doc">article
        in the newspaper</a> doesn't mention that.&nbsp; The earliest reference
        to the cross is in <a href="../Bridges-history.htm">Taylor's notes</a>
        for Bridges - &quot;the remnants still of a stone cross&quot;, 1718.</font>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">We also have <a href="church1892.jpg">a
        photocopy by GF</a> of some Architectural Notes on the church, dated
        April 1st, 1892 and labelled as Figure 89.&nbsp; The source is
        intriguing but is now obscure owing to GF's failure to write any notes
        on the reverse side.&nbsp; The large number of gravestones in this
        section of the graveyard must have been cleared by gardeners when the
        war memorials were installed.&nbsp; No notes remain of the inscriptions
        now lost.</font>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Note there is no
        pavement next
        to the graveyard wall and, behind the blurred horse, there seems to be a
        'flat' that remained after demolishing
        a poor house known to be sited against the wall, which appears to be
        recently rebuilt.&nbsp;There is record of church wall repairs by Wm.
        Sturges costing
        £6. 16. 1d in the church-warden's accounts for 1872.&nbsp;
        He does more in 1880 and 1887 that was recorded simply as 'on account'
        and might be also for walling.&nbsp; With this in mind the above
        photograph may be tentatively dated c. 1880.<br>
        <font size="2">The pronounced contrast in the church gable, between
        ironstone and limestone layers, is probably due to the newness of the
        walling (1855) and the use of an orthochrome film medium for the
        photograph, ie. one not sensitive to red/orange.</font></font></td>
