There was a milk bottle from Blisworth for sale on the Ebay.co.uk website on 25th November 2007.&nbsp; In an elapsed time of six days a few people of Blisworth
were watching the bidding to see who would buy it.</font>

By way of historical background, a John C Cherry came to Blisworth in 1930 with
two sons; Sid Cherry and his brother Henry Cecil.&nbsp; The brothers ran a dairy near the
Elm Tree through WWII war years and on to about 1957.&nbsp; The pattern of the
bottles was the familiar old-fashioned sort, one pint, with a two inch diameter cardboard
top which could be <a href="../Misc-just.htm#tops" style="color: #99CCFF"> 'punched out' in the centre</a> to allow insertion of a
straw.&nbsp; For school children bottles of 1/3 pint were issued early in the
morning at the school gate.&nbsp; The son of Henry Cecil, Derek, has commented that these bottles are not
particularly rare; &quot;people still dig them up and bring them to
me&quot;.&nbsp; But the bottles with M. Cherry on them are rare.&nbsp; There
isn't one in the village.&nbsp; They date back to the time
after Sid died in 1954, when <a href="../people-four.htm#mary" style="color: #66CCFF"> his wife Mary</a> took over running the dairy for a few
years and Henry Cecil worked for her dealing with the books and the
deliveries.&nbsp; In the 40s and 50s the dairy cows would make a journey between
the milking parlour near the Elm Tree and a field on the Northampton Road about
½ mile away.&nbsp; The very light traffic of the times just put up with this
7am and 4pm inconvenience but it wouldn't be possible these days.</font>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;
On Ebay the bottle carried an initial £2 bid from 'Terry' for about five days.&nbsp; By
tracing Terry's purchases it was evident that if any object was a milk bottle,
from anywhere, then he wanted it.&nbsp; It was not until the last hour of bidding that others
showed their colours while Terry remained content to just sit back and not
increase his bid.&nbsp; 'Wicked-Can' entered a bid for £15 which was later
upped to £20; the intention was that 'Wicked-Can' would make a gift of the bottle to
Derek Cherry.&nbsp; A confident looking 'Toy-Boater' came late on the scene and ousted 'Wicked-Can' with
a topping bid of £21.&nbsp; Time ran out and these intrepid bidders could only
gape at the screen, presumably, as some blasted unscrupulous 'Fantastic-Fox' made the deal
at £22 with a pre-lodged bid that obviously exceeded £21 by a suitable margin.&nbsp;
Such are the problems of any visit to the Ebay site.</font>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was this lovely bottle to go to a good home?</font>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were good reasons to suspect that the new
home would actually be in Blisworth.&nbsp; It would be unethical to state what justifies
such an assertion but, you see, all the bidders with the exception of 'Terry'
were surely from Blisworth - their Ebay names and so on spot-lit them admirably!&nbsp;
<u>Or so I thought</u> - someone pointed out that the bidder 'Fantastic-Fox' was in fact based in London.&nbsp; It is possible to look up information like that in the Ebay
pages.&nbsp; Meanwhile, a first draught of this web-page was posted with the aim
of pressurising the owner of the bottle, thought to be in Blisworth, to come out
and admit they have it.&nbsp; 'Wicked-Can' was me, by the way, and all of these
names are pseudonyms anyway.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><img height="142" src="group.jpg" width="170" align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened next was pretty surreal.&nbsp; Contact was made with
'Fantastic-Fox'
to direct his attention to the first version of this page.&nbsp; This
contact was made through Ebay's own emailling service.&nbsp; He was astounded
that his action in swooping onto the bottle had 'deprived' Blisworth of an artifact
that is part of village history.&nbsp; Considering he was a collector, he also seemed strangely
willing to part with the bottle, this eagerness becoming more understandable
when he explained that he wasn't a collector at all.&nbsp; In fact, he is part of the
management team at the Criterion Theatre in Piccadilly, London, and simply <i>wanted the
bottle as a stage prop</i>.&nbsp; In their comedic production of&nbsp; &quot;The 39
Steps&quot; the character of Richard Hannay encounters a milkman one morning and
it would be for that scene the bottle would be used.&nbsp; 'Fantastic-Fox' was planning to deal with the Blisworth bottle
in the same way as others, that is; paint white the inside of the
bottle to look as though it was full of milk, as in the inset, and add an old-fashioned cardboard
cap!&nbsp; Before he got round to that,
thank goodness, someone in London by chance turned up with a crate of old 1930s
milk bottles that had cost next to nothing.&nbsp; So the Blisworth bottle, which
took two weeks to get to London, would
not be needed anyway.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#FFFFFF"><img height="440" src="dayme.jpg" width="240" align="left">
 Then, in recognition of
our village history, the management team stated their desire
to donate the bottle to the Blisworth website and not accept any payment for
it.&nbsp; They had the bright idea of photographing some of the cast with the
well-travelled bottle and offering the picture for background interest on this
page.&nbsp; However, when they realised that I was going to be in the West End
early in January, to enjoy a Christmas present, they invited me to join them for
a photograph and the result is what you see here, actor Simon Day, who plays the
lead role of Richard Hannay in &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, handing over the bottle.</font></p>
<p style="padding-left: 50; padding-right: 50"><font color="#FFFFFF">Following
the original intention, it then only remained for me to deliver the bottle to
Derek Cherry.&nbsp; The lower photograph shows an original J. C. Cherry with the
lettering in red recalling the father of the brothers.&nbsp; The middle bottle
is an H. C. Cherry bottle but the lettering has gone, leaving little more than a
mark on the glass.&nbsp; The bottle on the right is the one that completes the
collection with M. Cherry.</font></p>

Andy Newbury managed to
pick up another bottle on Ebay<br>
so now the village has two of these. </font></p>
