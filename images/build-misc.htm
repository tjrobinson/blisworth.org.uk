        small barn with the main body of the public house.&nbsp; This ridge is

        is only about 5 foot high, the indications are that there was
        communication between the two parts.&nbsp; On the number 40 side there
        was a substantial hollow in which there fitted a cupboard.&nbsp; This
        picture shows the hollow more-or-less filled up with new brickwork.&nbsp;
        The wall has been subsequently rendered and the owner is not at all
        happy with the idea that the archway might be of sufficient interest to
        warrant an investigation.</td>

        Street.&nbsp; This was a window set high in the gable.&nbsp; The ceiling
        of the room of number 40 was once set across the middle of the picture
        as shown by the plaster covering.
        <p>This seems to be a clear indication that number 38 was built first
        with, at some stage, an adjoining single storey building (see picture
        above) - perhaps a barn.&nbsp; The adjoining part was later made up to a
        full height cottage.</p>
        <p>Note the group of poles used as lintels for the window.&nbsp; The
        location of number 38 and 40 High Street is shown in the <a href="High-Street/highst-detail.htm">footnote

      <td width="1182" height="495">There is frequent reference to buildings in
        Blisworth built to a Grafton 'model', circa 1870, apparently much loved
        by the Duke's wife.
        <p>Features are, scalloped barge boards, often built as twins,
        substantial chimney with 45 deg rotation in many cases, small concrete
        tiles set in broad bands - alternating square tongues with semi-circular
        tongues.&nbsp; Of course all were built in stone, and probably local
        stone.&nbsp; Many in Blisworth are plain 'white' limestone, some are
        banded and this one, location unknown, appears to be built with an
        iron-rich limestone/sandstone (has insufficient iron ore to spoil the
        freestone character).&nbsp; Most interiors had cramped or somewhat
        spiralled stairs.</td>
