        This project has already attracted some funding, £1000 in July from the
        Northampton Branch of the <b>IWA</b> and <a href="http://blisworthcanalfestival.co.uk/#/festival-report/4545489928">a
        staggering total</a> of over £4600 arose from
        the 2010 Canal Festival, but a little more is needed.&nbsp; Shown
        below is the area of interest, a section of the canal embankment near
        the mouth of the tunnel, with the green lines showing the present
        lines of paths that will be an approximate basis for the &quot;Walk in
        the Woods&quot;.&nbsp; Areas marked pink are the steepest parts of the
        embankment.&nbsp; The inset picture was taken in a cropped out beech
        forest in Oxfordshire but hopefully illustrates the eventual appeal of
        the place.&nbsp; The project was displayed at the Canal Partnership
        stall at the August 2010 Blisworth Festival to encourage suggestions from the community.&nbsp;

        later this year
        should make the whole area very attractive.&nbsp; An idea imported from
        the Yorkshire Dales may be set up; a &quot;money tree&quot; based upon
        an old trunk into which 1p and 2p coins are hammered into the bark by

        The Blisworth Canal Partnership was this week presented with an annual <a href="certif.jpg"> Volunteer Recognition Award</a> by the Canal &amp; River Trust, the new waterways charity entrusted with the care of 2,000 miles of waterways in England and Wales.&nbsp;
        As evidenced above, their work has included the transformation of an area of scrubland into a nature conservation area, planting it with wildflowers and tree saplings, creating a new pathway and nature trail, installing a new handrail to improve accessibility and organising the hugely successful
        <a href="../Festival/2012/account.htm"> 2012 Blisworth Canal Festival</a>.</font>
        <p><font color="#000080">John Highmore, volunteer coordinator at the Canal &amp; River Trust, said: The Blisworth Canal Partnership thoroughly deserve this award as they have dedicated a huge amount of time and energy over the years into improving this stretch of the Grand Union Canal. The effort from the volunteers has transformed this area of the canal, making it a really interesting and attractive place to visit.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Jan Andrews, from the Blisworth Canal Partnership, said: We are delighted to receive this award from the Canal &amp; River Trust and to be recognised for all the hard work we do. The canal in this area is really popular and we have really enjoyed helping to improve the area and making this stretch a lovely place to visit. Now we have a new nature trail and pathway we hope many more people will come and visit the waterway and re-discover their local canal.</font>
