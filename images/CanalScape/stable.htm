        To
        serve primarily as a temporary shelter for boatmen and their horse a
        stable building was once located at the top of the access path to the
        Tunnel Mouth as shown in <a href="../Canalone.htm#tug">a c1900
        photograph</a>. In about 1903 there was some work carried out to repair
        brickwork surrounding the tunnel mouth and, within a short period after
        that, the entire brickwork archway over the mouth was re-built. At about
        the same time, a new hut was established adjacent to the
        tunnel mouth and it is this newer building that is the current focus of
        refurbishing work, the original stable which may well have been
        accommodation for tunnel leggers at the top of the path having
        been taken down probably 100 years ago.&nbsp; The practice of legging
        through the tunnel was discontinued in 1871 in favour of employing steam
        tow-tugs and the new hut may have been used to store provisions for
        those steam tugs.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The building is being
        gradually transformed, as funds allow, thanks to the Canal Partnership, with some helpful support, that is - financial support,
        from the South Northamptonshire Council.&nbsp; Previous work near the Tunnel
        Mouth in establishing a wooded walk, carried out by the Blisworth Canal
        Partnership, is reviewed <a href="improvements.htm">in an overview article</a>
        on this website.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>New Gates, March 2013</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Phase One&quot; is the commissioning of a pair of stunning iron gates to secure the building as part
        of its restoration. It will be used eventually by local community groups, in particular school and scout and guide
        groups for art and nature projects. The building could also be let out
        for barbeque parties and the like. There are rumours that the hut has
        already been used in a nude photography session recently although one
        has to wonder what on Earth was the theme for that activity!<br>
        <br>
        The gates having a vines and leaves theme were carried from Stoke Bruerne to Blisworth on Saturday, 16th
        March 2013, having been produced by
        blacksmith <b> Bob Nightingale</b> at his workshop by the south tunnel mouth. They
        were then installed at the entrance to the hut. The gates were transported aboard the
        restored historic working
        narrow-boat, &quot;Greenock&quot;, which is owned and was helmed by <b> SNC</b> district councillor, Councillor Stephen Clarke, ward member
        for Blisworth and Roade.  The eventual effect of the restoration work will
        endow the tunnel mouth area with a better cared-for feel. Later work will see the painting of the hut's interior
        and that work will include some extempormuralising by our local artist John
        Percival.</font></p>

        Stephen Clarke, Bob Nightingale (Blacksmith, Stoke Bruerne) and Nick
        Scarcliffe (Canal Partnership) after loading the gates, the
        emergence of working boat &quot;Greenock&quot; from the tunnel, lifting
        the gates (that individually weighed over 300 lbs) from the bed of the
        boat, the gates being prepared with hinge bolts at each corner, then
        there is Beryl
        Payler with her cakes plus a cake provided by Bob Nightingale and some of
        the spectators at the event.</font></p>

        INTERIOR - THE MURALS</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><b>August - October 2013</b>&nbsp; Some artists who are
        members of the Blisworth Art Group have been busily painting an
        all-around mural inside the hut depicting the canal scenes to be seen
        outside, with the one adjustment being that &quot;the clock&quot; was
        put back 100 years for some of the motifs. The effect is startling. The first shots shown below
        show that the hut was prepared by mounting on waterproofed and painted
        walls a series of eight-by-four durable plywood boards, also painted and
        primed for the artists' acrylic medium; a total of about 64 feet x 4
        feet of painting area, funded by the Canal Partnership which holds a
        festival each year (see home page) that raises most of their funds.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="walls.jpg" width="770" height="237"></p>
        <p><font color="#000080">The scenes that are now applied show, at the
        respective ends of the hut, both the Tunnel Mouth and a view of the Mill Bridge.
        Along
        the long facing wall between these ends is shown a compressed impression of the canal
        towpath running by the Rectory-Park wall and by the overhanging trees of
        the embankment, including the &quot;Walk in the Woods&quot;. The panels adjacent to the entrance gates show
        some typical narrow-boat painting and scenes from the
        opposite bank of the canal, in particular the brick-built flume that
        carries Fisher Brook down to the canal's edge. There is a gap in the
        array which will accommodate a wood-burning heater that may be fired up for
        certain local community group events.</font></p>
        <p><img src="graphic.jpg" align="left" width="125" height="95">
        <font color="#000080">There are below some pictures of a selection of the artists.
        A link to view the finished work by the 16 artists in all, most
        of them members of the Blisworth Art Group, is provided at the end of this
        paragraph. Note that the art work is presented here as though the walls of
        the hut are opened out into a flat array, as suggested in the inset
        diagram. It will be necessary to use the <u>
        horizontal</u> scroll bar (which will appear automatically) in order to view
