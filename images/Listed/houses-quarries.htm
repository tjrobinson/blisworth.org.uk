        is to put the record straight. The question has been:-&nbsp;<b> what sources of stone
        were
        used for the notable houses in the village?<br>
        </b>Not all contention is dispelled by this paper. Perhaps the only way
        to clear up doubts would be to get stone samples analysed.</font></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Before 1800,
      Blisworth had a couple of limestone quarries towards the east of the parish,
      quite near to the Courteenhall Road. They are marked as Lime Kilns in
      Bryant's map of 1825. The quarries could have been opened in medieval
      times for providing stone for building and
      repair of cottages in the village. By the time of the fields
      enclosure in 1808 they were officially assigned to provide stone for road maintenance
      and, apparently, the Duke of Grafton instructed his agent to find a new
      quarry in order to sell stone. His agent (<a href="../Articles/Stone-works.html">Mr.
      Roper</a>) was actually already
      selling stone at the time and so he knew a likely place to establish a new quarry,
      that being just adjacent to one of the &quot;road&quot; quarries and in 1821 he
      opened it for business, opening onto the Stoke Road.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">Two buildings can
      be directly associated with the new quarry:<br>
      <b>
      (1).</b> <b>The Stoneworks &quot;Office&quot;</b> on the Stoke Road.&nbsp; It
      was built with stone from mere 100 - 200 yards distant, the date it was
      established is not recorded but assumed to be c.1830.<br>
      <b>
      (2). The Pair of Villas</b> built at the junction of the road to the
      railway station<span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"></o:p>
      with the Northampton Road. A new agent, Mr. Gardner, suggested to the Duke in 1838
      the site for
      the Villas as appropriate for advertising the quarry
      to anyone going to/coming from the station. So the date of the villas is
      1839.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The
      quality of the stone in buildings <b> (1)</b> and <b> (2)</b> is similar and not very
      durable. Pieces of stone detail have fallen off due to weather spalling over the
      150 years since they were built, in particular repairs to the villas were
      made in the 1990s and new lettering in stone was installed at the head of
      the Stoneworks building. Many limestone cottages and garden walls
      have also suffered badly over the years and have been liberally dressed with mortar at stone
      joints to minimise the weathering. Such cases are thought to be due to the
      weak stone from the Stone Works quarry.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font color="#000080">Consider
      two more buildings:<br>
      <b>
      (3).&nbsp; The Old Rectory</b> built next to the Church and finished in
      1842 for the Revd. W. Barry. The reverend had very high standards and was
      probably the wealthiest rector that the village has seen, coming we
      believe from the Whitby, Yorkshire area and from a family involve in
      shipping.&nbsp; This is what George Freeston said of the house in his
      4-weekly <i>Church News Letters</i> of January 1971, &quot;I</font><font color="#0000FF">t certainly appears that, with all this sudden change around his old Rectory, within his first three years of coming to Blisworth
      the Rector was prompted to build a new Elizabethan style Rectory a little further to the southwest of the old building. Although the Parish had a first class Stone Works and Quarry on the Stoke Road established in 1821, he chose to procure his stone from a quarry opened up on the Towcester Road at the Rectory Farm.</font><font color="#000080">&quot;&nbsp;
      Well, George was right in saying that the Stone Works quarry was shunned
      but totally wrong in declaring that the quarry on rectorial land was used
      instead. We know this because there is no stone in the Blisworth area that
      is robust to weathering, yet the Old Rectory has faired very well, at
      least for the elevations that show smooth ashlar faces (not so well regarding the chimneys). The
      rectory quarry stone is very shelly and friable, it is however of
      scientific interest and the access hole has been labelled a SSSI for a
      number of years. There is further comment about the &quot;Rectory Fm
      quarry&quot; in the next paragraph. Unfortunately, we have no information on this rectory building and
      who the architect was. The diocese has no resident expert who could help. <a href="rectory&#32;1926.jpg"><i>Photo</i></a>
      was taken in 1906 of the rear elevation.<br>
      <b>
      (4).&nbsp; The Church</b>&nbsp; This is what George has said and was copied
      into the <a href="../BBook/BBook.html"> out-of-print book</a> on Blisworth: &quot;</font><font color="#0000FF">A
      substantial old quarry on glebe land, near Rectory Farm, provided the
      stone for the 15th century changes to Blisworth church</font><font color="#000080">&quot;.&nbsp;
      George also mentioned that N. Pevsner had told him this. But the statement
      is <i> not </i> included in Pevsner's book on Northamptonshire buildings. That's
      just as well because it would have been a major 'howler'. The rectory
      quarry did not exist as far back as 1727 and the site in question was not
      glebe land then, let alone in the 15C, and we know this because it does
      not appear on the Grafton survey map of 1727. Instead, at that
      location, was a &quot;ridge and furrow&quot; field given the name &quot;Shelly Lye Furlong&quot; thus
      describing a particular stony nature of the soil there. By the time of the
      Ordnance Survey in 1883 the site was labelled &quot;Limekilns&quot; which
      speaks for the poor quality of the limestone there compared with the main
      quarry that was in business from 1821 to 1913 - though the latter part of
      that period found market for the stone only as flux for the Northampton
      blast furnaces. We know and are thankful
      that the stones for the church are of robust quality and even at the wind-scoured edges the stone shows
      moderate erosion for 500 years. Furthermore there is demonstrated a knowledge of
      the robustness of iron-bearing local stone (in the building of the church)
      as
      mentioned in the last paragraph below.<br>
      <b>(5).&nbsp; Blisworth House</b>&nbsp; We gather that the site was taken by a house, a Manor House, occupied by the Wake family from 1253
      to 1522 when the widow of Roger Wake sold the entire 'manor' to John
      Knightley of Fawsley. Thus the Lord of the Manor was not resident for a
      while. We can identify a house in existence by 1650 when Thomas Tibbes,
      from London, bought it (in <a href="../Development/manor-summary.htm"> the 'Crown
      sales'</a>) and lived there for ten
      years. His widow then relinquished the house to the Crown and it was then
      rented by the Plowman family until 1779 when their farming business
      petered out. The Plowmans established some unknown house improvement dated 1702 (and that date-stone still exists).
      The mapping of 1727
      shows two stories with a dormer level (four dormer windows) in a thatched
      roof. We know that the house was improved by 1838 by the Stone family.
      They added a large front central porch that covered the date-stone and a rear extension
      that doubled the floor area and with a double roof. It was <a href="Blisworth&#32;House.jpg"> photographed in
      about 1890</a> as a structure similar to its present state; ie. with&nbsp;
      elevations raised to three stories with a slate roof, all three stories
      re-modelled in Georgian style. The front elevation was partly covered in ivy in
      1890 and has subsequently been rendered and scribed with a faux block-work
      pattern reminiscent of very shallow rustication. The side elevations shows
      extensive use of squared limestone blocks and very little ironstone. The
      rear elevation was <a href="blis-house-1906.jpg">photographed in 1906</a>
      and shows only two storeys compared with the three at the front because
      the roofs are not equal. There
      are no indications regarding the origin of any of the stone. The 'core' of the house dates back to pre-1650 though it might be a
      problem to identify that core.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">In preparing for
      the book <i> Bridge's History of Northamptonshire</i>, questions in 1718 were
      asked of a number of reliable people in each village. The curate Revd.
      Bullyer commented Blisworth was in possession, for building, of a <a href="../Bridges-history.htm">white
      stone at the Saltway and a good Red stone</a>. We can identify a number of
      locations for white stone and the one at the Saltway must have been in Slatpitt
      Furlong. There is no obvious remnant of the red stone which we assume must
      have been an ironstone ie. a sandstone incorporating enough iron oxides to be
      extremely robust without being of 'ore grade' which would usually be
      unworkable. Revd. Bullyer made no suggestion where the red stone may have
      been found - comment is provided in the review of <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm">Blisworth
      Mining</a> and a mapped view of <a href="../Comp_Mapping/compmap.htm">all
      possible quarries may be found here</a>. There is a further suggestion,
      following this paragraph, for the site of a viable ironstone quarry. Many of our old cottages appear to have been based on a
      wall-plate consisting of ironstone, for example the cottages opposite the
      general store in
      the High Street and the house at number 31 Stoke Road - see below. The use of a mix of red
      and white stones, sometimes random, layered or banded, is common-place around the village and represents building
      activity from 1600 to 1880. The heavy use of ironstone may originate well
      before 1600 although the listing notes by English Heritage does <i> not</i>
      include that view. It has been occasionally mentioned that the period 1590 to
      1650 marked a village cottage improvement phase, seemingly discounting much
      building activity before 1585.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080"><b><u>Possible
      Ironstone Site</u></b></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="towroadquarries.jpg" width="800" height="512"></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080">The figure is a
      Lidar scan of the Towcester Road with features marked thus, P = Pynus
      Cottages, PF = the Parish field and GF = Glebe Farm. The field boundaries
      and road alignment from 1727 mapping are overlaid. Depressions and other
      surface features are revealed by sunlight rendering from the NNE. SP =
      Slatpitt Quarry, FI = the first known ironstone ore quarry and U1, U2 are
      U3 hitherto unknown depressions possibly quarries. The feature in the 1727
      mapping that draws one's attention to the depressions is the
      &quot;yard&quot; to the south of the road which, if the lines are taken
      literally, seem to extend the field that became the parish field. There is
      another area to the east that suggests <a href="../Farming/Fields/fields_inclosure.htm#animals">an
      animal enclosure</a>. Both this and the yard are close to depression U1.
      The
      kink in the field boundary around U2 also lays some emphasis on the
      depressions. According to Tonks (Eric Tonks' book <i>The Ironstone
      Railways of the Midlands</i> - Blisworth and its surrounding area is
      covered in part III) it was
      at the site FI, in 1852 (after the Great Exhibition in 1851), that a <a href="../Mining/Blisworth_mining.htm"> Mr.
      Clare and Mr. Hickman began extraction</a>. Their project failed for a lack of
      an effective carrier arrangement to get the stone to the canal. This site
      was where Grafton agents presumably directed the miners so it seems very plausible
      that the general area to the south of the road was for the red stone mentioned by
      curate Bullyer in 1718. Since the curate suggested no particular place we may
      assume that the site was disused by then (yet the mapped yard feature
      remained by 1727). The question of the location of an ironstone quarry is clearly a tantalising one.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 150; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080"><b>Notes
      on the Use of an
      Ironstone Wall-plate</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very many houses show the
      use of an ironstone wall-plate. They are listed below with comments. Some
      may say that, in view of the probable age of most of these houses, ie. 300
      years plus, the frequent traces of a wall-plate is quite indicative of
      what may be regarded as a building convention, not necessarily afforded in
      every case.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><font color="#000080">At the time of
      building these houses there was clearly an available supply of ironstone
      that was used by the Crown managers or the Duke of Grafton's agent in
      providing houses sufficient for the population. which might have been ~300
      in 1500 - 1600.&nbsp;In some cases the wall-plate may be considerably
      older than the main fabric of the house. No evidence was seen for timber
      supports in the outline of the building. Note that there are a number of
      well constructed houses, particularly Stoneacre (High Street) and
      Thackstone (Stoke Road) that show no use of an ironstone wall-plate at
      all, unless such courses are located below the ground level. The data
      assembled here does not prove a link between a cottage of considerable age and being built
      with an ironstone wall-plate. The data is presented mainly to place
      the constructions on record and merely suggest that maybe the smaller cottages were
      the norm in ancient times (with wall-plate) but were superceded by&nbsp; more substantial
      gable-to-road houses at a time when such wall-plate was
      deemed unnecessary as robustness in the foundation was provided in some other way.
      With this hypothesis I lay out my shaky stall and await discussions. Note that everyone of these houses are built high enough in the village to
      have their foundations resting on an ironstone strata. From No. 44 High
      Street, onwards, the substrate is blue clay.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Elmtree House</b>
      (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/elmtree.jpg">photo</a></i>)
      - the base is coated with a thick and strong mortar layer, to a height of
      about 14 inches. The wall surface and some of the mortar is supporting
      growths of lichen. The ironstone edges occasionally hint of the wall-plate
      behind.<br>
      <b>No. 32 High Street</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/32High.jpg">photo</a></i>) - a wall-plate that is much eroded by frost, ice
      and salt attack is periodically repaired with an amateurish use of stone
      and engineering brick. The effect is ugly but one wonders how old is the
      iron-stone that remains. This cottage is near one previous recorded
      adjoining the blacksmith's shop, now demolished, that displayed the date
      1613 with the Goodridge initials <b>NG . IG</b>.<br>
      <b>No. 34 High Street </b>(<i><a href="IBS-Houses/34High.jpg">photo</a></i>)
      - a similar wall-plate as shown at No. 32 but
      without so much erosion. Neither of these cottages are listed by EH - presumably
      because they have been subjected to too much modification.<br>
      <b>Crieff Cottage</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/crieff&#32;cott.jpg">archive
      photo</a></i>) - this cottage is actually a relatively modern
      cottage that has been refurbished in the1990s. Back in 1920 there was a
      high gable end facing the street with a substantial ironstone wall-plate
      but now there is left only a 6' high garden retainer wall with the same
      foundation. This gabled house was quite prominent and stood only a gate's
      width apart from the L-shaped Crieff House (before the <a href="../Greatfire.htm"> fire damage of
      1798</a> , see building labelled 'c' on Stoke Road in this reference ).<br>
      <b>No. 31 Stoke Road</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/31.stoke01.jpg">photo</a></i>) - this is a remarkable house that was built
      entirely in ironstone and in two separable phases, the second of which
      consisted of the addition of a barn on the north gable end. The two phases
      are distinguished in the photograph. Clearly the
      house rests on an ironstone wall-plate but that is completely hidden by a
      strong layer of mortar.<br>
      <b>No. 4 Northampton Road</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/4Npton.jpg">photo</a></i>) - this house has no obvious ancient features
      but, until the 1980s, there were upstairs a few separating walls
      consisting of willow/birch hurdling covered with daub, being testimony to
      its age. The wall-plate is
      partly preserved while the wall carries exuberant randomness in the
      stonework. Note also the use of ironstone block work for a repair - see
      below.<br>
      <b>Nos. 9 and 11 High Street</b>&nbsp;(<i><a href="IBS-Houses/911High.jpg">photo</a></i>) - display an incomplete wall-plate layer.<br>
      <b>Willow Cottage at Elmtree corner</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/Willow.jpg">archive
      photo</a></i>) - a substantial building that is
      setback from the roads. Recorded in 1727 as a house but in 1838 as an
      unoccupied garden house behind the house next to Elmtree House, ie. behind
      7 Courteenhall Road. Its varying status is a mystery that might relate to
      a dire roof condition at some stage.<br>
      <b>Building at corner of Little lane and Chapel Lane</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/mill_lane.jpg">archive
      photo</a></i>) - clearly built
      primarily of ironstone but demolished in 1938. The corner stones are set
      to provide a curve for easement for horses and carts.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="padding-left: 150; padding-right: 150"><font color="#000080">The following is a
      list, with comments, of houses in the village that carry, or carried, a
      notable amount of ironstone coursing within a substantially limestone
      construction. These are simply examples - there are others.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>No. 35 Stoke
      Road</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/35-stoke.jpg">photo</a></i>) - a building known to have been built in 1652, re-roofed in c.
      1850 with slate and refurbished generally in 1960. There is a prominent
      course of ironstone at the level of a presumed thatch eaves-line, evident
      in coarse blocks to the east (to the right) and well cut blocks to the west. The latter
      are presumed to have been placed in 1960&nbsp; along with the panel of
      whimsically cut blocks above it. Clearly there must have been a source of
      well cut ironstone blocks in 1960 but would that have been in the village?<br>
      <b>The High Street mail sorting house</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/mailhouse.jpg">photo</a></i>) - demolished in ~1960,
      constructed entirely in ironstone at some time since 1850 at which time availability
      was evidently no problem. The site was once occupied by a very substantial
      building until it was destroyed by fire in 1798.<br>
      <b>Cottage near the Chapel</b>  (<i><a href="IBS-Houses/chap-cottage.jpg">photo</a></i>) - demolished c. 1938 because
      it had become unsafe. Built
      without much ironstone but repaired with some well cut blocks at an
      unknown time. The original build date is unknown but probably before 1727.<br>
