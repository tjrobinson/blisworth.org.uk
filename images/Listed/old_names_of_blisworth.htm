        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">We find in &quot; The Place
        Names of Northamptonshire &quot; the following forms : In Domesday Book
        (1086) <b>Blidesworde</b>, and in later versions of the name from other

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">Domesday (1086) is the
        earliest date for a document mentioning our village by name, as
        Blidesworde, though it seems
        increasingly likely that Romans (50 - 410AD) settled here as, probably,
        did the&nbsp; Romano-British (400 - 700AD) before the influx of the
        Anglo-Saxons and Vikings whom we suspect created the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000080">The usual interpretation of the 1066 name,
        for example as stated by the &quot;Place Names Society&quot; at Nottingham University,
        is that it was the name of a settlement belonging to Blide or Blida.
        This is because the
        -s- suggests possession.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is a too willing a tendency to
        take this path in interpretation which should apply only in cases where the name
        ie. in this case Blida (or Blithe, see below) definitely appears in some other
        document - well, apparently it has not turned up in one yet!</font><p><font color="#000080">Perhaps
        there has been insufficient attention paid to the fact that during the
        period of the Danelaw, ie. at a pre-Norman time, this village was within
        its confines.&nbsp; Rothersthorpe is only 3 miles distant and has an
        unquestionably Danes' name. At a half-mile distance to the east of the
        village we have Thorpe Wood (both a wood and farm in the early 18th
        century) - <i>thorpe</i> being an Old Norse (ie. Danes') name for
        hamlet.</font><p><font color="#000080">Note
        first that the -d- in the Domesday name is served by the phonetic </font> <i><b>p</b></i>
        <font color="#000080">
        that is pronounced as either a -d- or a -th- or any soft blend between
        the two. Now we can
        resort to Ekwall's Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names,
        1964 Ed., and take note of all the given ramifications. The first part of the compound
        name may
        be Bli</font><i><b>p</b></i> <font color="#000080"> or Bli</font><i><b>p</b></i><font color="#000080">e (pronounced blid or blith) from the discussion on
        Bledisloe, blea</font><i><b>p</b></i> <font color="#000080"> (pronounced bleath and meaning <u> timid</u> or <u>sluggish</u>) from Blaston.
        Blidworth (Notts) is also attributed to Bli</font><i><b>p</b></i><font color="#000080">e. Then there is any of the above as a personal name.
        There are also variations of Blyth
        in the British Isles (often east-coast rivers) meaning <u> gentle</u> or
        <u> merry</u>  (as in 'babbling brook' ?) that seem unlikely to have
        stemmed from anyone's name.</font><p><font color="#000080">From
        <a href="http://www.orkneycommunities.co.uk/orkneyblidetrust/index.asp">Orcadian
        dialect</a> comes <i>blide</i> which is pronounced blyth and that means <u>well-being</u>.
        Our own English word <i>blithe</i> comes from the same source and means <u>happy</u>
        or <u>carefree</u>.&nbsp; From <a href="old_names_of_blisworth.htm#note">Shetlands dialect</a>
        there is <i>blyde</i> also pronounced blyth and that means <u>glad</u> and,
        of course, we have a current English word <i>bliss</i> that means
        just&nbsp; - well, <u>bliss</u> and, of course <u>bless</u>ed as in
        &quot;.. this place is blessed ..&quot;&nbsp; The OE dictionary indicates its origin as Old
        English from Germanic (ie. possibly Viking) and this is true for blithe
        also.</font><p><font color="#000080">In 1650 the secretaries writing for
        the Commissioner for Crown Land Sales spelt the village name as
        Blizworth and were probably recording how the locals pronounced it since
        a few lived in Blisworth and were called to appear in person and make
        their purchase claim and, if GF is correct, they probably said &quot;B l
        i z o r t h&quot;.</font><p><font color="#000080">It is perhaps the time to look
        again at all the spellings that have been found for our village name.
        There are so many forms of either blis or bliss, one must feel
        convinced, surely, that the name has never been much different from that
        though probably pronounced with -th- as 'Blithesworth' in its earliest
        form. If one goes with the Nottingham University idea of a person called
        Blithe then he/she must have been a descendant of Mr. Happy. That is
        surely a bit far fetched although one might imagine it as a Norman clerk's
        joking insertion of a generic name.</font><p><font color="#000080">An
        intriguing form of the name appears in a 1728 map of the neighbouring
        parish of Shutlanger to the south - there is a reference to a 'Blithworth
        Ditch' for a field name recorded by the same map-maker who in 1725 - 1729 never veered from either
        'Blisworth' or 'Blysworth' when mapping our parish. Could this be an example of an inherent
        imprecision in our 'tongue' that perhaps helped generate the range of
        names down the ages and maybe even popped in the 1086 -s- to which
        Nottingham University academics have paid attention?&nbsp;</font>
        <p><font color="#000080">A final note may be taken from <u> John R. Clark Hall</u>
        and his Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. Here is an extract: for which the letter
        given by the </font><b>ð</b><font color="#000080"> symbol is pronounced
        as &quot;eth&quot;, just like </font><i><b>p</b></i><font color="#000080"> 
        but this source is a different linguist. This encapsulates most of the above.</font><p><font color="#000000"><b>blîð blîðe<br>
        blîðe I. 'blithe,' joyous, cheerful, pleasant, Æ, AO, CP: gracious, well&#8722;disposed, friendly, kind, El:<br>
        agreeable, willing: quiet, peaceful, gentle, Ps: (+b. occurs at Guth 161^9). II. adv. Ps.<br>

        blîðemôd glad, cheerful: well&#8722;wishing, friendly.<br>

        blîðs bliss</b></font>
        <p><font color="#000080">Turning now to the second half of the compound;
        it comes from OE
        wor</font><i><b>p</b></i> <font color="#000080"> pronounced worth.&nbsp; This word can mean merely a fence
        but more commonly an enclosure, eg. within a village.&nbsp; If it is
        qualifying a personal name then it means &quot;the homestead of...&quot;
        otherwise the safest interpretation is that it referred to a fenced
        enclosure but this could become simply a place or location. As stated
        above, this phonetic symbol </font> <i><b>p</b></i>
        <font color="#000080">
        stands for the 'th' sound in the English tongue.&nbsp;It completely
        bamboozled George Freeston many years ago since he misunderstood it
        and claimed the village name was once <b>Blide's Worp</b> (rhyming with <i>warp</i>!!) in his <a href="../Articles/R&amp;A&#32;Articles.htm">first
        R&amp;A article</a>  listed here (1975).</font><p><font color="#000080">We are left with the
        conclusion that our <u>Blisworth</u>  name originates as a Viking-named
        homestead (maybe <i> but more probably not</i> belonging to a Blida or Blithe) or a poetically named place given of&nbsp; happy,
        timid, sluggish or gentle (for a stream) and healthy or merry attributes or,
        amusingly, a place belonging to someone with one of those as a
        nickname.&nbsp; Apart from the several rivers there is a plentiful
        supply of place-names with the same idea: Blythswood district in Glasgow
        centred on a hill overlooking the original port, being a kernel of
        prostitution in the 17th and 18th centuries but, in alluding to bliss, the subject of Vikings'
        thinking was probably on some more religious lines than that. We need to
        be cautious with Blythswood because of its location which is arguably
        within the &quot;Breton - Cornish - Welsh - Irish/SW Scotland&quot;
        regional band for which a (pre-Viking) &quot;Celtic&quot; root is acknowledged for
        their languages and not the &quot;Germanic&quot; one that applies to all
        of the above. Phonetically the word &quot;blythe&quot; sounds like the
        Welsh word for wolf - <i>blaidd (</i>also the Gaelic <i> - bleiddaiad)</i>. It is possible the name
        once implied
        &quot;Wolf's-wood&quot;.</font><p><font color="#000080">Then there is &quot;The Blithedale
        Romance&quot; by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1852) entitled in order to hint at the
        idyl &quot;Happy Valley&quot; of Samuel Johnson's &quot;Rasselas&quot; (1759)
        - the reader is encouraged to find some more . . . .</font><p><font color="#000080">Perhaps our humble brook was once
        called Blithe as it descended through the original 7th or 8th Century grounds
        before the concept of a Manor was invented by the Normans.</font></td>
